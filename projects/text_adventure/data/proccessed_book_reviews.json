This ambassador of the Caliph faithfully recorded much of what he saw there, among the barbarians, including encounters with the Oghuz Turks and the Norsemen who were then frequent travellers along the rivers of what would one day become Russia. (In fact some thinking has it that the Norse, in the guise of &quot;Rus&quot; -- eytemology unclear -- actually gave their name, along with their ruling princes, to Russia since the first major Russian state, Kievan Rus, was ruled by princes of viking heritage, with the help of second and third generation viking adventurers serving them as mercenaries.) But Crichton's book is not just a reprint of ibn Fadlan's manuscript (which is available, in English, in various scholarly tomes). Crichton enlarged upon the tale he found and appended an apparently fictional second half which takes ibn Fadlan north, in the company of his new-found Norse comrades, to the viking lands, there to face a shadowy menace of unknown origins. In this second half, Crichton blended historical speculation with the Beowulf tale in Old English (the chief of the viking crew which inducts ibn Fadlan is called &quot;Buliwyf&quot;) to suggest an ending to ibn Fadlan's adventures which surely never happened. But it's done quite nicely, hard to tell where the real tale ends and the author's fictional enterprise begins, and it keeps you reading right to the final moments. It's not a particularly stirring tale but it's thought provoking and well-paced and a wonderfully interesting way to do an historical novel. Am looking forward to the movie, THE THIRTEENTH WARRIOR (named after the reason the vikings insist on bringing their fastidious Arab guest along for the ride), to see how it was done. The tale is simple enough for this sort of treatment so it should make a bang-up film for those of us into adventure and the viking thing. Due out in mid-August of '99. -- S. W. Mirsky","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"As a child of a Pole, I have been appalled by the West's acceptance of the highly biased German or Russian\/Soviet views of Poland. Davies remedies that ignorance, and the inclusion of literature excerpts is a good way to demonstrate the cultural view of events...better than interpreting it based on bias. While Davies does have a rather romantic touch, it does not interfere with his scholarship. Histories of Poland written by Poles cannot always say as much.My Polish family got me this book, which I think is a great recommendation by itself.If you are at all interested in Eastern Europe, a must-read, and a fine antidote to the peculiar POV that there was\/is no Eastern Europe but Russia that dominated the history department at my alma mater.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I bought this book because I wanted to learn a little bit more about how teachers could teach various personality types. I'm not a teacher, I'm a parent. I was concerned that my child's personality was at the heart of her apparent behavioral issues in kindergarten.This book is terrific. It highlighted the various personality types, their needs and patterns in the classroom. More importantly, it armed me with some specific strategies I plan to take to her teacher.I highly recommend it not just for teachers but for parents looking for insights into how their children learn.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I remember watching the movie version of \"Flowers in the Attic\" ages ago and certain aspects of the story have stayed with me for all those years. So naturally I was intrigued to finally read the novel to learn exactly how all of those elements played out. V.C. Andrews' \"Flowers in the Attic\" is a thoroughly engaging and entirely readable novel, a disturbing and twisted gothic fairy tale of sorts that will keep readers wondering long after they have finished the book.Chris and Cathy Dollanger, along with their twin siblings Cory and Carrie, have led the perfect life. They have a beautiful mother and father who love and dote on them, buying them pretty much anything their little hearts could desire. Yet when a terrible accident kills their father, Chris and Cathy's world is shattered forever. They quickly learn that their mother cannot take care of them and that she has a whole side to her that they have never known. Her only hope for keeping her children is to return to the mansion where her mother and father reside; cold, brutal parents who disowned her eighteen years ago. In the hopes of insinuating herself into her father's good graces, the four children are snuck into the house and hidden in the attic (supposedly only for a short time) until their grandfather dies and their mother can reclaim her inheritance. The children, bewildered and grieving at first, go along with their mother's plan because they believe in her. But as the days turn to weeks to months to years, the children desperately want out of their prison ruled by an abusive grandmother and a mother who no longer seems to want to be troubled with them.\"Flowers in the Attic\" is written from Cathy's perspective after they have escaped from their prison, so readers know from the start that things turn out somewhat \"good\" for the children. Yet Andrews manages to create suspense that keeps readers turning the pages desperate to know the extent of abuse and treachery these defenseless children experience. Andrews ably captures Cathy's 12-15 year-old voice, yet the narration sometimes gets annoying due to certain sytlistic choices. It is an intriguing, disturbing read - one that is good enough to stand on its own - and also an excellent start to the ones that have followed it.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I cannot convey how highly I regard this book. My only regret is that I hadn't discovered it earlier. It may sound strange, but this book reminds me of the Bible in that it is narrative with moral commentary. He describes his life as a slave and intersperses it with the thoughts he had at the time and the thoughts he had currently as an adult after an accumulation of knowledge.The narrative is often intense. You feel for him and for what he sees. When he is hurt, you feel hurt; when he's angry, you feel angry; when he is hopeful, you feel his hope. You share his longing to escape and are disappointed when his attempts are thwarted. I often got choked up in parts of this book. While some of his slave masters were better than others, there are really no decent white people in the first 21 chapters. When he meets the abolitionists and visits Europe, decent white people show up and you can feel his (and even your) estimation of white people go up.This book often epitomizes the struggle between good and evil. The white slave masters represent conniving and tyrannical evil and our protagonist represents the good man, highly ethical and faithful to his dreams of overcoming oppression. I often could see ideas that would later show up in Martin Luther Kings writings and speeches. His experience of white people in Europe reminded me of Malcolm X's experience of white Muslims; in both cases their opinion of white people were elevated. One of the biggest surprises of this book was Douglass' humor. Often when I saw pictures of him, he appeared very stoic; this was far from reality. He often indulges in humor and even poignant sarcasm. His sarcasm impressed me because it is so like my own. I laughed and smiled when he would attack racism sarcastically.One further thing I think is worth pointing out in this book is the portrayal of religion. I had often thought that people who wear their Christianity on their sleeve are usually the biggest frauds. I've been a Christian for 11 years and I have not changed that view. Frederick Douglass describes the slave owners that appeared to be the most religious as the most abusive. This did not surprise me. I have always been suspicious of Christians that go out of their way to make their faith apparent. This book proved what I have always thought about religious pretensions.This book was a blessing to read. I had a difficult time putting it down. I am now looking forward to reading a collection of his speeches.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I was slightly disappointed with this book. I was looking for some good Catholic examples and advice on mothering, and for the most part that is what this book contained, but I still thought it was lacking. Each of the twelve chapters contains an essay written by a Catholic mother, with a brief description of her just before her essay beings. While interesting, not all of the chapters are particularly useful. One is just a short poem. And many of them have negative views or at least references to Vatican II, which, unlike the other reviewer, I did have a problem with. Most of the stories talked about the self-sacrifice of motherhood and the trial and tribulations of taking care of a number of children (all of these mothers had four or more children), which was somewhat depressing at times, but also inspiring. This book was delivered to me at just the right time, as my 18 month old was sick in the hospital for nearly a week, so it definitely helped me as I read it. The best story in there is \"Shannon\" which the editor admitted that it has been previously published before in numerous sources.Overall I feel a bit mixed about this book. I was let down, for some reason I was expecting more, but I am not sure what. I was bothered by some of the negative views of Vatican II. Mostly I feel that it could have been so much better, I hope that there will be a revised edition in the future with more modern stories to add additional wisdom, especially for the present times. I would really only recommend this book to those Catholic mothers who are isolated and are looking for good Catholic examples of real Catholic mothers and those who are going through hard family times, for any reasons.","sentiment_score":0.6},{"review":"&quot;This is the story of how Much-Afraid escaped from her fearing relatives and went with the Shephard to the High Places where 'love casteth out fear.'&quot; This is probably by far the best book I have ever read. It has helped me so much in hard times and grief and has helped me so much in obtaining the peace that is only available through Jesus Christ. In the the book the main character Much-Afraid is given a chance to got to the High Places, a place where all of the people in the Valley of Humiliation (where she lives) long to be. However, before she goes there she must travel through places such as the Desert, the Shores of Loneliness, the Valley of Loss, and the Great Precipice Injury. On her journey she is accompanied by her two companions Sorrow and Suffering and is always being attacked by her relatives named Pride, Bitterness, and worst of all Craven Fear. In each part of her journey learnig a key lesson. All people who read this I implore you to read this book.

While considerable quantities have been found in the former ancient sites, and they have been collected since ancient times, few works were available to help the collector distinguish between the actual ancient works and fakes and copies made after. Works that are available are hard to find, usually specific to one forger and quite costly. I can safely say that this book clearly outlines the things to look for, from the commonest tourist cast copy to the advanced techniques used to fool the more advanced collectors.If you want to collect coins you should include this book as one of your first buys because it can save you many times its cost with the purchase of just one coin that is not right. This is especially true if you are buying on the internet from sometimes unreliable impersonal sources.The format is great with a show and tell approach, easy to use, and references to other works on specialized areas of counterfeiting.While it shows and concentrates on mostly ancient coins the information is valid for all copies. There are great plates of the fakes the average modern collector is apt to encounter now on the market. This book will help you acquire the basic knowledge necessary in collecting coins just as in any other facet of collecting antiques or art.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"As much as I enjoyed &quot;Songs in Ordinary Times&quot;, the Mary McGarry Morris novel that I recommend to anyone who loves to read about great characters is &quot;A Dangerous Woman&quot;.

The frequency list of 4304 words comprises the bulk of the text and each words is given with its frequency, part of speech (+gender for nouns), an English gloss, a short example sentence and the number of occurrences per million words and an indication of the register that they most commonly occur in. In the back is an alphabetical index for the words so that the location of a particular word in the frequency-sorted list can be found. A number of additional lists are included (eg: collocations with 'Zeit'). All the features needed are there.What I dislike about this book:Not much. It does everything it sets out to. The glosses are sometimes narrow, but with a limit of 3 per word, they do a good job in the space available. Since this is a frequency dictionary, the most important part is an accurate and easy to reference frequency list, which it has.Who might use this book:A learner who wants to be efficient about time use. For example, althoughLangenscheidts Grossworterbuch Deutsch als Fremdsprachedifferentiates between 22 different uses of the verb 'setzen', and this may seem like a lot of work for a learner to work through, this dictionary tells you that 389 words in every million are setzen, so learning to use it properly is a good use of your time. &Uuml;bersetzen, however, with just 3 different meanings, only occurs 45 times in every million - that is, setzen occurs 8.5 times for every instance of &uuml;bersetzen. The one to learn first is clear. Starting with the most common word (you guessed it, der\/die\/das) and working down can be a good use of time. Of course you need to use other resources to properly learn the word, but this dictionary shows you which ones to do the work on.Another use can be better understanding words whose definitions are often self-referential. For example, daher, deshalb and deswegen are all synonyms, and this dictionary gives you an idea of which is the most common (deshalb is #264, daher #330 and deswegen #833, so deshalb is far more common than deswegen).Where to from here:If you want to learn vocabulary, and use your time well, buy this. But of course you will need a number of other resources to learn the words well.

For example, for Thomas Wolfe, it isLook Homeward, Angeland for Gustave Flaubert, it isMadame Bovary. For Joseph Conrad, it isHeart of Darkness, and it still rankles me that it was adopted as a metaphor for the Vietnam War inApocalypse Now. The better intentioned readers will often say... someday... I'll read another work by that author. And I'm pleased to say that that someday has finally arrived, and I read my second work by Joseph Conrad, one that seemed better and more insightful that the one normally \"assigned.\"Conrad was born a Pole, lived for a period in exile in Russia proper, with his parents, and was orphaned at the age of 11. He commenced to \"seek his fortune\" in the merchant marines, at the age of 16. Nautical themes are the subject of several of his works. English is his THIRD language, and it is truly humbling to recall that while reading his exquisitely crafted prose, like beautifully polished fine grain wood.\"Under Western Eyes\" opens in pre-revolutionary Russia, in the first decade of the 20th Century. The majority of the novel however transpires in Geneva, in the milieu of Russian revolutionaries and poseurs. The narrator, sometimes direct, at other times indirect, is an older English teacher of languages, who is the Western eyes of the title, and believes himself an impartial observer, an \"inertial reference frame\" if you will, of the machinations and power struggles of the revolutionaries, primarily, but also of the Russian establishment figures as well. The action commences when a student revolutionary, Victor Haldin, assassinates Mr. de P--, the President of the notorious Repressive Commission. Haldin then turns to a fellow student he does not know well, Razumov, to assist him in his escape. Haldin is betrayed to the quintessential establishment figure, Counsillor Mikulin. However, it appears that despite Razumov's actions, he is \"tainted,\" and must seek exile himself in Geneva, where, inter alia, he develops a relationship with Haldin's sister and mother. It is a deeply psychological novel, and much of the action is in the drawing rooms of Geneva, where the revolutionaries pose, and establish pecking orders. Of the several sub-plots and minor characters of interest is Peter Ivanovitch, who supposedly made a spectacular escape from the Far East of Czarist Russia, with the help of a woman, and thence became an ardent \"feminist,\" though he sure manages to abuse his housekeeper \/ stenographer. Another theme in the novel is similar toThe Red Badge of CourageAfter the \"battle,\" with Haldin's demise, who really knows what happened, and is it possible for the coward and villain to portray himself as the hero?Conrad was generally considered to be politically conservative, with a strong distain for revolutionary elements, and certainly in this novel many do not come off well. However, Conrad also paints an exceedingly bleak picture of living conditions, and the repressive nature of Russian society, certainly sufficient to motivate revolutionaries. In his notes, as an afterword, Conrad says: \"The obligation of absolute fairness was imposed on me historically and hereditarily, by the peculiar experience of race and family, in addition to my primary conviction that truth alone is the justification of any fiction...I have never been called before to a greater effort of detachment: detachment from all passions, prejudices and even from personal memories.\"I firmly believe that Conrad succeed in his stated objective above. The novel is also an excellent \"spy novel\" filled with intrigue and duplicity that inspired Graham Greene, W. Somerset Maugham and John Le Carr&eacute;. Prince Peter Kropotkin famously said that the worse things are, the better, since reform is the enemy of revolution. Counsillor Milulin understood this dictum well, and is why he fought the revolutionaries, so that his reformist agenda could succeed.It was a bitter cold February day in Santa Fe, NM when my hiking friend and I sought refuge in an excellent second-hand bookstore.

The book is primarily geared toward the novice. And as such, it will show you the ropes -- by first explaining something, then having you actually perform a series of steps that demonstrate and reinforce what you've just learned. In a nutshell, this is a tutorial-based approach to learning UNIX. And I've long been an advocate of this approach to learning computers, especially when learning something unfamiliar. In my opinion, it is simply the very best approach to getting you up to speed quickly.Most other books on the subject of UNIX seem to be references, rather than tutorials. While the reference books are essential for an intermediate to advanced user, a good tutorial-based book is much better for the novice student. In that regard, this book is perfect.Lastly, the text printed on the pages is larger than you'll find in other books, but it's essential to how you will work with this book. You'll be looking back-and-forth between the book and the computer monitor, and the larger text will help you easily find where you last left the page.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This scholarly and well-researched book reveals and analyzes the sources and influences in the development of Mexican counterculture, especially in relation to rock music.

There is a daily reading, morning and evening, of various scriptures that are all on the same theme. It was compiled by the Bagster family of London, England.

The family prayed over, discussed and agreed on each scripture and sometimes it was weeks before it was felt that they came to an agreement. Not one word has been altered from its conception (1794). Hundreds and thousands of Christians have read the same page with its message of comfort and help through the years since it was first published.

The only lighting on stage illuminates Krapp (Crap?) and his table where the tape recorder rests. We don't see anything of the environment, only the center stage. We are expected to ask where the play is taking place. It could be an afterlife library where the story of our lives is kept in ledger books and on audio tapes. Krapp is forced to confront the details of his life as an atonement or penitence.It could be Krapp's own library where he has kept a video\/written record of his life. As Krapp faces the end of his life he chooses to relive his past before the last whimper of his extinction. Krapp is reading the ledger book of his life much as God and Saint Peter will read the ledger of our lives on judgment day.Krapp gives a rambling and emotional monolog relating his life experiences and decisions. He speculates about things that might have been better.At one point Krapp hears a noise from the shadows, outside where the stage directions indicate lighting. He either hears the rustling of the robes death or of the angel of death. He does not seem concerned that death is approaching implying that he is aware of his impending end. He gives a shrug and continues with his search of the ledgers.Waiting for GodotEndgame and Act Without WordsI completely enjoyed and highly recommend this book.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"\"Outlaw of Gor\" is the second book in John Norman's Gorean Saga.

He sets out to discover why Ko-ro-ba has vanished and gets sidetracked in a quest to free the city Tharna from its tyrannical rule by the Tatrix of Tharna who is a woman.The book shows how when women are put in power they can be just as mean as men. In the first novel, the men are oppressing women, but in this novel, in the city of Tharna it is the other way around. The book also shows that some bad people can be changed into good people if they are shown what it is like to be victimized by others.\"Outlaw of Gor\" is a fast read just like \"Tarnsman of Gor\" is.

This is good history and it makes for great reading.

I will not attempt to review the work itself, rather I feel compelled to comment on the Kindle Edition's few, minor short-comings. The Kindle text was obviously scanned in from a printed source. It may have been spell-checked, but it was evidently not read by a human proofreader.At location 765, I was surprised to find that Wolfe was described as being dressed in \"... yellow silk pajamas and yellow suppers with upturned toes.\" Really? Wolfe was wearing his food? Interesting ... And again, at location 1,412, Archie complains to Cramer, \"You scold us when we He, and you scold us when we tell the truth.\" There are other unsettling instances as well, things which should not have been allowed to make their way into any edition in any media, and would not have passed a human proofreader. The above two instances are clearly a common scanner problem of reading the letter ell: \"suppers,\" is, of course \"slippers,\" and \"... when we HE,\" is clearly \"... when we lie.\" I can understand a scanner's difficulty with these characters, but I really cannot understand why no one proofread the Kindle edition before offering it for sale. A published edition is, after all, a published edition, and even Kindle books should be held to the the highest standards.This observation being made, I am quite pleased to be able to tote a variety of Nero Wolfe mysteries with me in the convenient Kindle format!","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"In modern-day America it seems that people are constantly questioning authority. Law after law is challenged, or even disregarded, by Mr. and Mrs. John Doe.

Centering around a supposed murder, and cattle thievery, a group of men form a posse to exact their own idea of retribution. Van Tilburg Clark lets the reader know how anger leads to irrational and hasty action by the way the characters' emotions shift from moment to moment. The posse fears that the law will not punish the criminals in a &quot;just&quot; way (death). Therefore, the posse sets out for a lynching. The story is told in a manner that never allows the reader a moment of rest, always wondering what will happen next.

Yet Yates, to my mind, is easily the equal to any of the aforementioned names and belongs on the same literary shelf. He failed to find a wide and general fame before he died in 1992 (though, I believe, this book was up for the National Book Award in 1961 alongside Catch-22), and it is only recently that his name is being revived. He is revered by writers such as Tobias Wolff and Andre Dubus (who was a student of Yates').Without Yates there is no Raymond Carver; he was the natural heir to Fitzgerald and mentor to those writers willing to take up a dangerous literary thread: the exploration of the depths of our self-delusion, our virtually incessant need for self-validation, and most importantly, our progressive moral disintegration. Never flashy in his style, nor even particularly poetic or lyrical, spare in his descriptions which seem, in spite of their austere quality, to strike the mark with a terrible sharpness, Yates was a great genius of plain prose. His writing is like a bear trap, hidden in the leaves, waiting to slam shut and catch the reader completely unawares. This kind of writing should have gained a wider readership, but it did not. Perhaps because, like the bear trap, when it closes on you, it hurts.I myself had not been aware of Yates at all (something a writer friend found incomprehensible) until it was suggested I read Revolutionary Road. I read it, and I still have not recovered. Revolutionary Road is considered by many to be Richard Yates' best work. I think it is probably that and a lot more.This book is one of the most powerful works of fiction I have ever read and certainly belongs in the company of the best American fiction written after WWII. I say that without hyperbole. Yates was as close to genius as any of his contemporaries, and this book in particular is written so close to the bone that, after I had finished it I wondered how Yates himself survived the effort. Apparently he did, but only just. I do not know if I have ever used the word masterpiece in any of my Amazon reviews; I don't think so. I would like to use it now. This book is a masterpiece. This book reads like a string of thoughts coming from inside the reader's own mind. It's that good. And the end is so powerful that I found myself weeping. I felt as though I had been waylaid, sucker punched. I did not expect anything like that to happen.Having said that, it should not be thought that this book is some kind of \"downer.\" It is way beyond those kinds of simplistic descriptions, besides which, it is often very funny. The portraits of middle-class American people of the 1950's are concise and devastatingly honest. Depending upon where you are in your own life at the time you read it, it will obvously have different effects. Some people may hate it. For me it was nothing short of life-changing. I know that sounds exaggerated, but that is the effect this great work had on me. I encourage anyone who is interested in what great fiction writing really is supposed to be to read Revolutionary Road. Along with all these tags I have used, great, genius, masterpiece, etc., it should be remembered that the writing in Revolutionary Road is extremely accessible. The sentences flow effortlessly, the book has its own momentum.It should not be taken - from this review - that Revolutionary Road is one more swipe at an old and obvious target, the alienated middle class suburbians who have had a bullseye on their backs for generations of authors, nor is it merely another scathing attack on the emotionally-removed characters of the soul-barren Fifties (though I must take pains here to mention that the author himself said exactly that, \"I meant it more as an indictment of American life in the nineteen-fifties.\") While this is certainly a clear enough statement and we should take the author at his word, as a reader I have to take exception to this extent: the layers and depths Yates has uncovered propose - I believe - a greater intellectual and emotional map than even he had intended. While it is, as he says, an \"indictment,\" it is also a deeply compassionate book. The author's own pain at writing this shows a soul who is both furiously angry and filled with loathing yet desperately and almost fatally loving. So great is his skill that both these irresolvably conflicted emotions are able to co-exist on the page. Yates knew this life, and he seems to feel what the people he writes about here feel. He is not superior to his characters but lives in their skin. Rather than taking a broad brush to it, he goes at it with a finer tool and teases up the nuances so often lacking in the more obvious fiction of the genre. Once I had read the first sentence I felt a kinship with the writer. I was hooked. I hope this happens for you.NB: I have altered the last paragraph of my review slightly in order to include some of the information and insights which I have recently gained as a result of having read the brilliant and searing biography of Yates by Blake Bailey called, \"A Tragic Honesty\". I do suggest that the reader familiarize himself with Yates's work first by reading three or four of his novels and his collection of short stories before tackling this very well-written (and in its own right, painfully revealing) biography.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This is a great book!

Hammett supposedly considered it his favorite among his own novels. I liked it-- a lot, even. It isn't my favorite-- I think that honor still belongs toRed Harvest. But I don't consider it (as many apparently do) one of his minor works either.There is a very nice quality of remove to this work. We learn next to nothing about the past of the characters (perhaps why some readers find it difficult to connect with the work?). Instead, their actions speak for themselves and the implication certainly is that the events of the book represent a fatal intersection of oft repeated actions. \"You are what you do,\" is what Hammett seems to be insisting here. I personally find this kind of noir writing much more compelling when it sticks to the surface in this way-- gives it an air of fatality and sadness that would only be undermined by too much backstory. He doesn't give us much hope for his bleak city. Only Beaumont seems to have any feeling for nostalgia, and that is undermined by his gambling nature-- his casual lack of ethics.It's an uncomfortable book, I'll give you that. Hammett keeps the reader back from any feeling of resolution, even when we learn the \"truth\". For me, it neatly foreshadows a film likeChinatown. The system of corruption in the world of The Glass Key isn't something that can be defeated by anything as trivial as a redemptive character arc. Hammett is telling us something about the world-- the hope will have to come from somewhere else.Wonderful, really.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Classic, timeless, beautiful fiction.

The prohibition of slavery, the humane treatment of the mentally ill, the advocacy of the rights of prisoners, opposition to war, and opposition to the death penalty are all manifestations of the Quaker faith which have helped shape our world.Smith conveys his personal experiences and insights on what it means to be a Quaker in simple worlds, gentle prose, and honest introspection. This book is an enjoyable read for people of all faiths and non-faiths alike.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Moby Dick is a tribute to craftsmanship; Melville's writing craftsmanship's drawing from his former experience in the whale fishery to paint a vivid picture of the lives and toil of thirty men in a deranged quest for revenge on a \"dumb brute\".Each one of the crew members holds a special pride for its own mastery of the many trades combined to make Nantucket whaling so dominant. We see the pagan harpooners, the cook, all the mates, the oarsmen, the carpenter, the blacksmith... The only crewmember that takes pride in having no pride is Ishmael.Towards the end of the book Ahab cries at the height of his 58 years, 40 of it dedicated to whaling. He thinks of how little he has enjoyed of life, thinks about his young wife whom he seldom sees, thinks about how much more he could have reached if he only could have aspired less. Isn't this the age old paradox of capitalism? Till you get to be captain, the higher you rise the harder you toil, and after you become captain things do not improve much.This is why Moby Dick is so hated by high school students. You have to toil away on your monkey-ropes before you can truly appreciate it. I just finished reading Moby Dick for the first time now that I am 37 years old.

People tend to regard as strange those among their fellow passengers who giggle as they read. Giggling is always a hazard with Pratchett, as is interrupting other people's activities and forcing them to listen to you reading a passage out loud. This one features Commander Sam Vimes and Vetinari the Patrician, two of my favorite recurring characters, as they try to deal (each in his characteristic way) with a territorial dispute that wants to become a war. Klatch, only a short distance across the sea, is a sandy country full of turban-wearing camel-riders who also invented astronomy and vindaloo, which gives the author lots of opportunities to show up rampant nationalism for the insanity it is. (I suspect he was thinking of the First Gulf War here, as well as British attitudes toward immigrant Pakistanis, but there is also considerable relevance to the present war in Iraq.) Vimes vehemently resists being a military man (cops are NOT the same as soldiers) but finds himself involved anyway. And Vetinari has no use for the social and economic waste of war. Plus, there's the political sub-plot, and Corp. Nobbs's search for a lady friend of his own, plus the questionable ability of Leonard of Quirm (inventor and artist extraordinaire) to deal with the so-called Real World. Pratchett is a genius of comedy -- in the sense of the Human Comedy.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"This book has been my first source of information about Begonias since I first found it on the shelves of the library back in my high school years. Later, when I started my Garden library, it was one of the first books I sought out and, after forty years, I still refer to it often.Other books have since been written, but few give such a complete guide to the care and propagation of begonias, as well as a good outline of the varieties of begonias available at the time of writing. Although thousands of hybrid varieties and hundreds of new species have been introduced since, many of the varieties she describes are still available.She starts by telling us what a begonia is and gives us a picture of the many types of plants in the genus and the range of habitats. The opening paragraphs of this introduction include what I consider some of the most poetic images I have ever read in a non-fiction book. It left me with an appetite to learn more about the genus Begonia that has never been sated. There is always more to learn and it is usually fascinating.she then follows with an excellent section on how to care for the plants, (One statement has stood out in my mind for forty years. Speaking about light, she says that if you can read the pages of a phone book, there is enough light for most Begonias. The book is filled with such simple, common sense pieces of advice.) followed by an even better section on propagation. This is followed by a section on common pests and problems. It is interesting to note that most of the insecticides she mentions are now outlawed. It is a wonder that so many gardeners from that era survived since some of those chemicals were a hundred times worse than agent orange. It is also interesting that most of the problems she describes are easily solved by changes in culture rather than by chemical treatment.But the meat of the book is the sections devoted to the many varieties available and how to care for them. This is a major work in itself since there are presently 1,600 species of begonia and more being discovered every year, and they come from every part of the tropical world.She handles this problem by dividing the genus by growth habit, with an outline of the cultural requirements of each type. she then divides each group into easy, intermediate and difficult to grow varieties. Of course, there is not enough room in the book for all of the varieties available at that time, but she does quite a good job of covering the most important ones. A greenhouse containing only the plants she mentions in the book would have to cover several city blocks and contain at least three different climate zones.The whole tone of the book is basically practical, commonsense advice, She deliberately avoided the technical in favor of simple,everyday language. As a high school sophomore with little knowledge of scientific and biological language, I had no trouble following her comments and descriptions.For those with who want a more technical coverage of the Genus, there are more complete books available, but for a beginner who just wants a overall picture of the genus and some excellent advice on how to grow them, this is just about the best book ever written on the subject.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This is a riveting book . McDevitt's writing style is engrossing. He slowly gives us hints as to the true direction of the plot. His character development is quite strong, especially Kim, who is multidimensional; confident, but bumbling; intelligent, but slow to realize the danger that she is truly in.Humanity is portrayed as being at the crossroads. We have been exploring, but are now stagnating. McDevitt's view that we bungle the first contact is well thought out and plausible. Of course, we believe that there would be a cover-up of this major blunder. McDevitt's ending is self contained, but it leaves us wondering if there will be a sequel.

His thoughts on what he considers the precipice of the information age. He couldn't possible have known what was in store for this world as it progressed through the late 19th and early 20th century. He certainly would not have understood that the later half of the 20th century would give rise to more knowledge, advent, discover and technology... to more science and understanding than the entire history of humanity thus far. Yet here in his own words he shows that with forethought one can have an idea about how things will pan out.Draper seen the conflict of Religion and Science as ultimately lost by religion if it simply did not adapt to the new knowledge being uncovered in his day and what was to follow. It was probably okay in the 16th, 17th or 18th century to have a 50 year debate on a single subject since science moved rather slowly. It was NOT okay to do that in 1874... and its suicide to think people will do so now with a world of data at their fingertips. In his mind Religion picked a fight they knew they could not win by insisting on absurdity when demonstration said otherwise and that continuing in this manner would simply spell the death of religion. The ultimate threat of 'forget your idea or we will kill you' is now simply gone. Which leaves demonstration in place of forced subservience.For its part in the 1800' those proselytizing science as an 'understanding' of the word tended to face off against religion giving it essentially a forum to make its point.Since this time scientists have learned not to bother questioning religious doctrine. To them the battle is won and most don't care what the worlds religions say. They now simply get on with the job and the voices of those in the religions camp may do as they wish. This is one of the reasons Japanese, Chinese, European and Indian scientists agree the situation in the USA is terrible... but really couldn't be bothered to do anything about it. They know that either the science will demonstrate itself, or it will be forcibly curtailed... either way those are political things that might happen and will not impact on the philosophy of science or its knowledge base. Once discovered and used you simply can't put the science genie back into the box.This book was added to a list of 'banned books' by the catholic hierarchy. Its still on that list even though the catholic church now accept every word of it. But in the In the 1870's that was more or less a sales aid and only served to increase sales of the book. Moreover I find it interesting that to ban such a book someone inside the church had to read it. Surely if its okay for them and only served to have them ban it, then its okay for their congregations?Drapers work in this book was mostly a discussion of the works of others.I find it amazing that although this book is over 140 years old, and even though the things we can easily demonstrate to ourselves on a kitchen table in 2012 are known by many... that some people still see the world in the light of nonsense that those lesser educated did in the centuries before even this book was written.Moreover almost every point raised by those who argue for creation mythology is mentioned and quashed in this book from 1874! These things were known then...we've passed an entire century and there are still people who think the world is 6k years old...Home schooling is not an excuse either... Draper himself was home schooled by his father, a creationist clergyman.I would recommend this easy to read tome to anyone with an interest in the social and scientific evolution of the United States.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"In short I would say the book is ok. The book is dominated by young guys who have not been trading for even five years. They have not traded a secular bear market, a secular bear market for tech stocks, had to deal with decimalization, or have had to deal with incredibly rangebound and lackluster markets of years past. While not doubting the talent or the results of the traders interviewed in the book, I would like to see where everyone is in 2010. This book was written in the sweetest spot of the NASDAQ market most of the traders, myself included, will probably ever see in our life times.If you are a new direct access trader this book is worth a read. If you are an experienced trader just trying to continually polish your game-I'll save you a 250 page read and twenty-some bucks. Cut your losses, let your winners run, be disciplined, use instinct, be a fast typer, trade with the trend, get long stocks in a strong market, get short stocks in a weak market, don't monetize your trading results, don't let your ego get in the way, and the market is always right.

Tobie Gene Legingston lived through the rough years of the segregated South, became part of the huge black migration to economic independence in the post WWII years and helped create a biking culture - one of working-class pride in Harley-Davidson motorcycles - that continues to this day.

One or two years later I discovered the Adventure series and they were even better!\"The Valley of Adventure\" is the best of all 8 volumes (with \"Castle\" a close # 2 and \"Sea\" probably the third best, but many Blyton fans list \"Sea of Adventure\" as their favorite).The book is interesting from the first chapter on when the four children and Kiki, the parrot, are invited by their older friend Bill, who is a special agent, to join him on his trip in his new airplane.ATTENTION!!! Contains Spoilers!!!At the airport the children witness some shooting and in the confusion they enter the wrong airplane, not the plane belonging to Bill.How they end up in a secluded valley in Austria, hide in a very romantic cave behind a waterfall and find their way back to civilization is suspenseful enough to be read by adults, not just by kids.The book for the deserted island!One more tip: make sure to buy an Adventure edition that contains the great illustrations of Stuart Tresilian (the newer editions don't have them).

It was every bit as lurid as advertised, but is generally a very close cousin to Raymond Chandler's Marlowe novels in character and tone, though the plotting is much less convoluted and we don't get quite as entangled with secondary characters or setting. Spillane emphasizes Mike Hammer's incredible toughness and verility on every page, with all the usual gumshoe vernacular, and as with the best detective novels, character counts more than crime.

But the actual universe is also unimaginably huge (viz. very much larger than the observable one) and is potentially divided into vast number of separate regions whereby different laws and parameters may actually exist. These speculations are indirectly supported by theoretical physics and cosmology (e.g. string theories and eternal inflation), and provide an \"explanation\" to the Anthropic Principle - i.e. why our local world is so very fortunately hospitable and conducive to intelligent beings.I particularly like a couple of the author's quips. On page 302: \"If you purchased this book hoping to find the ultimate answer to how the universe began, I am afraid you will be disappointed.

This time however, on a recent two-month trip around New Zealand, tired of these major players (which always seem to rely more on their brand name rather than quality) I decided to try Footprint and the work of sole author Darroch Donald.I can say without a shadow of a doubt the book was a valuable companion and the best and most entertaining guidebook I have ever come across.The style was so refreshing and at times most amusing which was a nice change from the usual stuffy historic ramblings and bland descriptions.Over all, compared to other guides I have used and regarding New Zealand in particular, I felt it was very well researched, accurate and up to date. The fact that the same author (who obviously loves the place) wrote and researched the entire book was also a major asset.Of course there are a few spelling errors and I did come across the odd company or restaurant no longer in existence, but that is to be expected of any travel guide.I was also interested to read about the omission of Milford Sound. In the book I purchased Milford Sound was included in the text so I presume this was just an error in editing with the first print run.So in summary don't hesitate-I thoroughly recommended the Footprint New Zealand Handbook and now travel as a true convert to the company.

There are so very many levels and angles this little story can be viewed from.....It should be remembered that this book was published at the eve of the horrible Spanish Civil War. It should also be remembered that it was published at the same time Earnest Hemingway was publishing his work addressing bullfighting and the ultra macho culture he expounded. Hemingway, in his own way was defining the qualities expected in all males and was actually quite successful at it as his writing influenced an entire generation in one way or another. As you read the story of Ferdinand you cannot help but wonder if the author, Munro Leaf and the illustrator, Robert Lawson had an agenda of their own. I personally feel they did - taking a shot at Hemingway not being the least. But of course that is pure speculation on my part and as I indicated above; others will come up with a different take after reading the book. This is good.The story of Ferdinand is pretty well known by this time. It is the tale of a bull that did not want to behave stereotypically as bulls are suppose to behave. He simply did not want to fight. As one reviewer in this forum has so well said, \"Ferdinand is the kind of character that if they gave a war, he simply would not show up.\" I liked that. And the key here is that despite of everything, Ferdinand stuck to his guns - his principles. Ferdinand was a pacifist to say the least. He followed his own drummer and did his own thing despite the pressures placed upon him to do other wise. Now I am not what you would call a pacifist by any means, but I most certainly respect those who are; those that don't just talk the talk, but walk the walk.No, this supposedly ferocious bull much preferred smelling flowers under a tree and thinking thoughts that peaceful bulls think.The illustrations in this book are sort of a work of genius. We have a case here were the author made the illustrator and the illustrator made the author...there is simply no other way to put it. The illustrations are in black and white - we are talking the book here, not the Disney film, and are quite clever. The picture of the cork tree with corks hanging on it is often used to illustrate the sneaky quirkiness of the artist, and rightfully so, but I find the presentation of the portrayal of the matadors hilarious preening and the wretched condition of the Banderilleros as the enter the ring on their exhausted horses speaking volumes as well as the portrayal of the proud Picadores that have broken lances (Adults will delight in the imagery here - the symbolism), and again, exhausted horses. (You must remember that on a personal basis, I am extremely anti bull fighting and supposedly cultural icon or not, a barbaric practice that should never have survived into the 19th century...but hey, that is just me).We of course, if you think about it, find that this work examines the way humans use animals and the way men, boy and indeed bulls are suppose to act. Is suppose, for me, the overriding message in this little work is that a person should \"do their own thing\" and not worry all that much over the expectations of others - i.e. our society; being an individual can often times be the right thing to do.There are good reasons why this book has stayed in continuous print since 1936 and is still a favorite among children and indeed, adults.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This is yet another great story by Dickens. Throughout the book I kept thinking, I know what will happen. How obvious. What was obvious was how wrong I was each time. Follow young Pip from boyhood to manhood. See how he goes to become a gentleman (make his fortune in our terms) and what comes of it. This is a story about growing up and learning what is important in life. It is full of Dickens' excellent descriptions and characters and their relationships.If you like any Dickens story you will like this one as well. If you have never read Dickens, you should.For Kindle owners. I only saw two errors. Both words probably had accents on characters as missing characters appeared as question marks (?), so I am not positive what the words actually were (one was French) and to be honest, I never bothered to look them up.

When she recieves a letter from Dr.Trent saying she has a year or less to live, she decides to speak her mind and please herself. Valancy goes to help an old friend who lives with her father(who is nice even if he's drunk all the time). The girl is dying and Valancy comforts and helps her. And while she is there, Valancy meets Barney Snaith, and discovers the love and romance she never knew. I won't say any more about that because it would ruin the plot if you haven't read it. All the time her family feels disgraced and thinks she has gone crazy, which makes the book very interesting and funny.

Eccentric Lizzie is well known for her flights of fancy already and no one has ever taken them too seriously, so the fact that Ida felt perturbed enough to write to Laurie is bothersome enough, and Laurie can't help but worry. Her whimsical old aunt is apparently, incredibly, seeing fairies in the woods, and they don't appear to be entirely benevolent.After a serendipitous phone conversation with Doug, the half-brother Laurie hasn't seen or spoken to in years, the siblings head home to the secluded Idlewood estate to find out exactly what's going on. The aunts and their brother, Doug and Laurie's Uncle Ned, all live together in the old house, and Laurie is uncomfortably aware that at their advancing ages they may not be able to live entirely on their own for too much longer. In fact, she becomes convinced that while she's been away, someone or several someones have been taking considerable advantage of the old people, particularly of Lizzie. She has some astonishingly realistic photographs of what do indeed appear to be fairies, which have even Laurie - who is well aware of the notorious Cottingley hoax - perplexed. In addition, there is a mysterious young man living in a guest house on the property who seems to have weasled his way firmly into the lives and hearts of the old people, and both Laurie and Doug are suspicious of his motives.As the malice seems to step up with the siblings' arrival, Laurie begins to wonder who she can trust. Everyone seems to be keeping secrets as they all dance around each other with frustrating, reticent half-truths, and it's only when Laurie finally gets a little too close to the heart of the matter that the whole pot boils over.The odd title refers to Gan Ceanach (Gancanagh, Ganconer, Gan-Ceann), an Irish fairy whose name literally translates to `Love Talker' in English. He's known for hanging about in woods and glens, smoking his clay pipe and seducing young maidens with his enchanting voice before departing in a swirl of mist, leaving them to pine after him the rest of their days. As a character he doesn't play any real role in this book so I suspect it was just an intriguing title to use.Vintage Elizabeth Peters (although it seems more along the Barbara Michaels line and I wonder why she wrote it under the Peters name), fun and satisfying as always.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"A Little Piece of Ground is a beautifully written story that humanizes a Palestinian child and shows that he is just the same as other children the world over - all he wants to do is play.This book should be read by all the children of America who take for granted being able to play outside.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This Yellowstone cult favorite is both chilling and engrossing.

I will also confess that it did not strike me as exciting as the 1st book (The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, for us.) But, while this book was not as exciting for me, it kept my 10 year old son constantly eager for \"one more chapter.\"In the book, when the children (from The Lion...) are whisked away to Narnia, very quickly they meet someone who begins to set the stage for the adventure they are about to have by explaining some things that have happened since they have been gone. I was quite ready to get on with the children's adventures well before the explanation was finished.I am not saying that you did not need the background information, or that it was written in a manner that would bore a person; I'm saying that I was eager to see what would become of the children I was familiar with and who had just barely been reintroduced when the explaining begins.I believe Lewis started on the train station to better tie in this book with the last--right away he starts with characters you've come to know and, hopefully, love--but that is where he traps himself. Having started you off on their story, he breaks for half the book to tell you another boy's story.(My daughter just told me now that Lewis used the train platform to set up a theme of being drawn in--and that Lewis always felt that you saw things only from the \"magician's perspective,\" and not from the perspective of those whom the magic was done on or to.)At any rate, by the time the explaining is done, you are not only eager to be on with the adventure to find out what happens to our four famous heroes, but also because you want to know how the new boy makes out. (Only, now, you will have to wait a while to find out what happens to him. This reminds me of The Two Towers--how you have to wait half the book to find out what happens to Frodo and Sam and then read the other half about them while left hanging about the rest of the party--and I wonder what it is about second books in a fantasy series.)What I loved most about this book was what transpired when Lucy first thinks she sees Aslan. From there until the children are reunited with him, there is something in the way the children interact with each other, and in the way they behave, which shows that these characters are growing and changing through their experience, and it adds depth to some of them and a realness to others. I found myself even more interested in their well being after this section of the book.Lastly, we get to find out what happens to the other boy while finishing the tale of our four heroes. There is battle, the odds are not good, and everyone must play their part if good is to conquer evil again in Narnia.My son really enjoyed the fighting part, as most boys his age do, and he would always beg for one more chapter when we were done readying. If I said no, being forbidden to read ahead, he would pick up the book and read through the chapter titles and stare at the picture and review the story in his head (up to where we were) and try to imagine what comes next.And there you have it. While I did not like it as much as the first (The Lion...) book, I did enjoy a certain part a great deal. Meanwhile, the intended audience, my ten year old son, was \"spell-bound,\" so I have chosen to give the book 5 stars. Perhaps it is only a 4 1\/2, but I cannot go as low as 4 stars, so 5 stars it is.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Enter 1 Hobbit and 13 dwarfs + 1 aged wizard and you get an wonderful adventure!

The beginning is wonderful, but then the execution of the idea fails.

I have read it so many times that the cover is falling off and the spine is incredibly damaged. Basically, Pride and Prejudice focuses on Elizabeth Bennet, a young and independent woman whose mother is trying to marry off her and her sisters to the highest bidder. They have several suitors, including Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Wickham. At first glance, Pride and Prejudice seems just like a regular Regency romance (making you wonder why it is such a widely acclaimed book); however, it is much more than that.In Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen offers social commentary on a wide range of subjects, including corruption of the Church, marriage, and women's rights. In addition, each time I read it, I realize more and more that not only is Jane Austen a genius, but she also has a great sense of humor (this can been seen through Mr. Collins, the wordy church leader, Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth's social-climbing mother, and many of the other characters). Several of the minor characters are used as stereotypes in order to get Austen's point across (for example, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, one of the snobbiest rich women in all of literature, and Lydia, Elizabeth's flighty youngest sister).Even if you don't care about Jane Austen's views on the society of her time, Pride and Prejudice still offers a lot. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy have perfect chemistry, as do Jane and Mr. Bingley. Elizabeth is way ahead of her time--no women of her stature were expected to be picky about who they married, but Elizabeth is not willing to settle for anything but the best. Then of course, there's the idea that you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them and that you shouldn't let your pride get in the way of your opinions about others (hence the name Pride and Prejudice).This book is great for everyone-it contains romance, comedy, and even politics of Austen's time. Although the language might be hard to understand at first, it's definitely worth reading.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"When I first read this book, it took about six pages to get into the style he had written in (it's written as if in shorthand, which is the way Candy, as the &quot;author&quot;, was writing).

No footage, save \"St. Louis\" Blues, of any of her performances exists. And while she left a treasure trove of recordings from nearly every phase of her career (except for the last), very little of her story has every been told except for repeated myths.This book rights that egregious wrong is righted by Chris Albertson's book. Meticulously researched, Albertson's well written book is the most intimate look at Smith's life we are likely to get. Much of what Albertson recounts, in fact, comes directly from people who were close to Bessie Smith, and who worked with her. Along the way, Albertson unflinchingly debunks some of the oldest legends about Smith, up to and including the truth about the circumstances of Smith's death.Albertson expertly pulls back focus to give readers a picture of the times in which Smith lived and worked, during a 27-year-long career, just enough to give the reader a complete picture before zooming in on Smith again. The result is not just a record of the life of Bessie Smith, but a record of her life and times.Albertson uses Columbia Records archives to tell the story of Smith's recording sessions throughout her career, offering brief reviews of Smith's recorded performances, and note her collaborations with other legendary artists from Jellyroll Morton, to Louis Armstrong and Bennie Goodman. It was enough to send me to iTunes to download some of Smith's catalog. Afterward, I took to reading the book while listening to Smith's music as a soundtrack. If you've heard these songs before, you may listen with new perspective after reading Albertson's account of the recording sessions.The author makes clear in the introduction and throughout the book the depth of his admiration for Smith and her artistry. It would have been easy for him have given us a hagiography. To his credit, he produces a \"warts-and-all\" biography that takes into account not only Smith's talent, but her strengths and weaknesses as a human being in a style that reflects throughout his respect for his subject.The result is as full and human a picture of Smith as we're likely to get, instead of the stereotype of a hard-drinking \"blues mama.\" That Bessie Smith lived much of what she sang about is made clear in the telling of her story, but Albertson writes of her joys and triumphs too. Smith sang the blues, but her life consisted of both joys and sorrows.To tell the truth, I didn't want this story to end. The last part of the book is perhaps the most compelling, because of Albertson's portrayal of Smith's determination to grow and adapt as an artist, and keep up with the changing times. He makes it clear that she was at the beginning of what looked like another upward climb. And even though I knew how it was going to end, I couldn't help rooting for her. I also couldn't help wishing that someone had thought to record and\/or film her in this last phase, in the midst of evolving. If I had that time machine, this might be the period I'd go back to in order to hear Smith, and to catch a glimpse of what she was becoming.It was in the middle of this that the people knew Smith and were interviewed by Albertson started talking about \"the last time I saw Bessie.\" Like them, I felt her story had ended far too soon. But I was glad I got a chance to read it, as they were glad to have been a part of it.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"From the instant I cracked open the book I was finding nifty efficiency builders that I hadn't know of before--and I've been using DW since the first version.Users tend to get set in their ways and find what works for them, but this takes you to the next level and helps you create, work (and even play) a little quicker.If you're a beginner, this is an outstanding resource.

Leibniz was as G. MacDonald Ross makes clear a ' polymath' not simply in the sense that he had knowledge in a wide variety of areas, but rather in that he sought to make out of this knowledge a comprehensive and deep understanding of the world. He too was the subject in Voltaire's Candide and in Swift's Gulliver of much ridicule, the man of vast schemes and optimism who could be chided for not really knowing what practical, common sense, everyday life was about. But he was not so ' simple-minded' as his satirical critics make him.In fact his search for knowledge led him into dialogue with the most distinguished minds of his time. His vast correspondance fifteen- thousand letters was according to him the real abode of his wisdom and knowledge even more so than his books. Because of his diverse interests he somehow rarely completed anything including the many technical projects he worked on. His contributions to mathematics,and logic, to metaphysics and science are each given separate chapters in this work. His interests however extended into law, politics, religion, and also some of the pseudo- sciences such as alchemy. A civil-servant in the court of Hanover, living under the protection of patrons he was often accussed of ' working at everything but that which he was paid to work for'. He was the intimate of royalty and a consulted expert in the whole subject of 'dynastic succession'. In this biography we get no sense whatsoever of whether he cared for personal or family life in any way, though we do learn that his sole- heir was his sister's son. Leibniz only a small part of whose writings have been translated into English is considered one of the great universal geniuses of mankind. But he is also mocked as being a ' pure rationalist' whose emphasis on the life of the mind made him a bit less than human.This is a rich little book. One detail of it intrigues me especially.

The connection between these Vedic scriptures, created some 1,500 years before Christianity, and the Gnostic gospels discovered at Nag Hammadi in 1945 is striking.In \"The Gnostic Gospels,\" Elaine Pagels discusses Gnostic similarities with Buddhism, but the central doctrine of the Gnostics--to know oneself at the deepest level is simultaneous with knowing God--is much better understood by delving into the oldest Hindu scriptures of the Upanishads. Its most central discovery, \"Tat tvam asi,\" (literally \"You are That\") or \"the Self is Brahman [God],\" shows how closely the Gnostics were thinking to the earlier Hindu mystics. But this same idea is hinted at in the New Testament when Jesus says, \"Because I live, you also shall live. In that day you shall know that I am in my Father, and you are in Me, and I am in you.\" (John 14:19-20) or \"Has it not been written in your Law: `I said, you are gods'?\" (John 10:34), which points to this concept being found in Psalm 82:6. Buddhism is not concerned with God and rejects the concept of the Self (Atman) which is found in Hinduism. For this reason, the Gnostic Christians were much closer to the theism of Hindu belief than the agnosticism of Buddhism. Even terminology is the same between the Gnostics and the Hindu mystics. The Gnostic secret sacrament of the redemption (\"apolytrosis,\" literally meaning \"release\") has its counterpart in the Hindu term \"moksha,\" also meaning \"release,\" which in both cases marks the culmination of self-realization. The resurrection for the Gnostic became this moment of enlightenment when one becomes spiritually alive rather than the traditional interpretation of physically dying and being brought back to life at the end of the world. The parable of the prodigal son in the New Testament (Luke 15:11-32) gives us this same view: the son who was spiritually dead becomes alive again through self-realization or gnosis (meaning \"insight\"). Pagels points out that Jesus' own resurrection is described in spiritual terms in the Gnostic gospels, but similar incidents can likewise be found in the New Testament accounts where he appears spiritually (as well as physically) and changes his appearance. Interestingly, the disciples do not recognize Jesus in some of these cases until they use insight.What do we make of these metaphysical events? Pagels' explanation of \"imagination or unconscious\" workings of spiritual fantasies (\"like students of a painter or writer, expected to express his own perceptions by revising and transforming what he was taught\"--page 19) fails to impress this reader. We don't see scholars offer creative fantasy as an explanation of the transfiguration accounts in the New Testament. Political correctness dictates why we usually get no explanation for supernatural events from unbiased biblical scholars, but the supernatural was a much larger part of culture in Jesus' time than today. Dreams were considered to be a gateway to the \"spirit world\" (as they are with many modern indigenous tribes), and the significance of dreams and other altered states of consciousness through \"visions\" are a regular part of the Bible. If we look to the Upanishads for how the ancient mystics explored the Self, we find it involved drastically altering one's consciousness through meditation, and the Upanishads describe the dangers of such journeys. We also find similar accounts by medieval Kabbalists using dangerous conscious-altering techniques to enter the \"palace of God\" (not unlike accounts of Native Americans and other indigenous people who enter the \"spirit world\" through similar practices). Such a journey to \"the third heaven\" is described by Paul in 2 Corinthians 12:1-4, complete with \"unspeakable words,\" reminding one of the Kabbalist secret words used to gain safe passage. Paul mentions \"a mystery, a wisdom which is hidden\" by God (1 Corinthians 2:7) and the Gnostic Valentinus pointed out that Jesus shared certain mysteries with his disciples that he kept secret from outsiders, \"To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables\" (Mark 4:11). Pagels mentions that traditional church leaders such as Irenaeus accused the Gnostics of \"magical impostures\" and Gnostic practices did include \"sacred vowels,\" which were also used by pagan magicians in the ancient world. Considering the Gnostic Gospel of Thomas shares almost half of the same material found in the canonical gospels, and some of its traditions may be older than those found in the New Testament, the possibility arises that Jesus himself used Gnostic mystical practices, and Pagels gives information to support this. Add to this that some of the earliest Christian writings in the New Testament (Mark, 1 Corinthians, and 2 Corinthians) mention these hidden mysteries and supernatural visions, and you have further evidence for mystical practices being used by Jesus and his closest followers.She mentions the work of E. R. Dodds and Gershom Scholem, which supports the view that Gnosticism was a movement whose writings derived from mystical experience. Scholem has specifically written that Christian Gnosticism was an outgrowth of Jewish Gnosticism, and he has suggested Kabbalah may have its roots in this same early period. Accepting Scholem's theory, one could say the Essenes were a Jewish Gnostic cult that embraced Zoroastrian ideas of dualism, and some of these ideas filtered their way into Christian Gnosticism and traditional Christianity. But Pagels does not delve into this area or even consider that Jesus may have been a Jewish Gnostic. Interestingly, the parable Jesus tells of the kingdom of heaven's growth from a grain of mustard seed (Matthew 13:31-32, Mark 4:31-32, Luke 13:18-19) is similar to ideas found in both the Upanishads and Kabbalah--writings closely connected with mysticism. In the Upanishads, the fullness of absolute reality (God) called \"sat\" is reduced to Oneness. In the same way, Kabbalah speaks of the infinite realm of God being reduced to a concentrated point called in Hebrew \"Ein Sof\" (which literally means \"infinite\"). Does Jesus express the same mystical view? Is the relationship between the tiny mustard seed (\"the least indeed of all seeds\") to the complete tree in the parable somehow comparable to the relationship of the \"primeval atom\" to the complete universe in \"Big Bang\" theoretical physics? Modern Hindu writers and Kabbalists point to this similarity as scientifically validating their respective doctrines, but we usually don't get this same interpretation from modern Christian theologians. Maybe we would if a Gnostic doctrine remained intact and fully became modern Christianity.In the introduction, Pagels points out the Roman Empire brought Jewish theology in direct contact with religious ideas from other cultures in cities like Alexandria. If scholars accept that Judaism acquired Mesopotamian and Persian influences during the Babylonian Exile, why is it surprising to suggest the influence of Hindu and pagan mysticism in early Christianity, especially when writers have long noticed some of these same elements? The dichotomy between the Old Testament and Gnostic Christianity is a result of these different beliefs fused onto traditional Judaism (which already had Gnostic elements introduced during the Exile). Gnostic Christianity appears to be the result of trying to explain the disturbing elements of the Old Testament (the vindictive, jealous, and blood-thirsty portrayal of God) with everything else that was absorbed at this time. Gnosticism appears to be a melting pot of ideas fueled by older pagan and Eastern mystical traditions, and these influences can be found in Christianity itself, with its \"kinder, gentler\" God.Pagels' chapter on \"God the Father\/God the Mother\" is right on target. I was surprised she did not relate the combination of masculine and feminine to the concept of the \"divine family\" found within paganism. It should be no surprise the Trinity has its origins in the concept of god-father, goddess-mother (also daughter), and son (sometimes with a mortal parent, as was the case with Jesus). We find this concept throughout pagan religions in the pre-Christian Mediterranean. Pagels points out the Father and the Son are described in masculine terms in the New Testament, but reveals the Greek term for Holy Spirit is described using the neuter term \"pneuma.\" Of course, translations of the New Testament render the Holy Spirit as being male, but history and the Gnostic tradition suggests otherwise. Again, a possible early influence traceable to Kabbalah appears, but Pagels makes no mention of it when referring to the Genesis account of man and woman coming from one source created in \"our likeness\"--one God containing both male and female characteristics as exemplified in the Sefirot of Kabbalah. But old influences die hard, and the concept that was there from the beginning worked itself back into Catholicism with worship of the Virgin Mary as the divine feminine concept, reestablished from Gnosticism and paganism. Pagels mentions women served as priestesses in Christian Gnosticism, but she does not mention there were priestesses in rural Judaism--another sign that Jewish Gnosticism may have been established first. (Mandaean tradition even has Jesus' mother serving as a priestess!) In the earliest days of Christianity, Pagels mentions Paul's greeting of a noteworthy female \"apostle\" (Romans 16:7), and there also happens to be a record of a woman \"disciple\" that Peter brought back to life after a recent death (Acts 9:36-41). All this was recorded before the hierarchy of the Catholic Church went into effect. This suggests Christian Gnostics were acting more closely to the norm of Jesus' ministry than the later church.Her chapter on \"The Politics of Monotheism\" shows why the Catholic Church stamped out Christian Gnosticism. Interestingly, this is similar to the way that traditional Judaism stamped out its older (Gnostic?) rural cults. As traditional Christianity grew politically, it was bound to follow the male-dominated structure of society. It shed the egalitarian order introduced by Jesus where leaders could also be servers (Luke 22:25-27). The rotating order of authority used by the Gnostics was replaced with the permanent male-dominated political hierarchy of the Catholic Church. A belief system stressing inward development toward self-knowledge of God was replaced with the political structure that Christian churches ultimately follow today. The concept of the One became the concept of the many. In this way, the idea of a shepherd leading a flock became the perfect metaphor for a church doctrine of following by example rather than discovering for oneself. Pagels shows this doctrine allowed the church to thrive and grow through a powerful dynamic of devout belief and political hierarchy.Pagels is one of the most gifted writers on early Christianity, and she uses her sources very well. She covers much territory in a concise and clear manner, but this book could have contained more information and broader conclusions. The Gnostic gospels raise important questions that religious scholars are reluctant to examine. If we dismiss the strange visions found in the Gnostic gospels as inspired creative fantasy, then how do we explain some of those same elements within the New Testament itself?","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Today Tweetsie is known by many only as an amusement park between Boone and Blowing Rock North Carolina.

This is quite alot to add to a book that is already so beautifully and painstakingly illustrated.

Perhaps the cover illo from a post WWII sci-fi paperback? Japanese calligraphy on a grain of rice?

After the publication of 'The Hero and the Crown', it seemed that McKinley was a heaven-sent for all us fantasy-adventure-girl power bookworms out there. Damar took Middle Earth outside and spanked it. It didn't get better than 'Beauty'. 'Outlaws of Sherwood' didn't really seem to know what was going on, but still had enough charm to outweigh it's fuzzy characterization and wavering plot (we forgave her, it's Robin Hood, what can you really do with him?) We endured through the grotesque and morbid yet charismatic 'Deerskin', even though some of us would rather we had not; we braved through a 'Knot in the Grain', although her anthology seemed more made of grain than knots; 'Rose Daughter' seemed a bit of a reprieve from the muddle, yet despite being as beautifully written as ever, McKinley's charming and fond tribute to her former home didn't let us in the door. Then came 'Spindle's End', and by then end of it, I had almost given up hope. I regretfully came to the realization that McKinley's wondrous worlds of magic and heroics had eaten her alive. Where were the fond characters that we loved because they were so like us? What happened to the magic that used to be thrown in to the story without spoiling the plot? Honor played dragons by jumping out of trees and scaring people, feared teacups, and said \"errrr....\". Rosie whatever-her-name-was from `Spindle's End' was raised on bear milk and there was a talking house, and the fairy-smith love-interest guy I don't think spoke two words. The book still rang with McKinley's humor and intelligence, but the small, underlying tones that had made her early books so rich and alive had reared up and taken over. There were no small sounds anymore. Everything was overstated, underdeveloped and never really did anything. It was as if some hideous person had taken the worst parts of everything McKinley had written and made some slapstick collage. I gave up and moved on to Sherwood Smith.Then came `Water'. The three stories in the book were like postcards from old friends. I don't know where it went, but when I read the last story, `A Pool in the Desert', I knew without a doubt that whatever it was that had made `Beauty' and the Damar books so great was still there. I waited to see if it could still be teased out into a novel. Along came `Sunshine'.The first novel written in first person since `Beauty', `Sunshine' pulls the melodrama of `Deerskin', the unexpected magic of `Rose Daughter', rehashes the heritage issues of `The Hero and the Crown', sets it in a world as brilliant as `A Pool in the Desert' and gives it's hero as much kickass as Harry from `The Blue Sword'. As if we weren't being spoiled enough, McKinley pulled out her finest skill, and draws out characters that are as real as the kid sitting across from you on the bus, yet have wild twangs of magic underneath their skin. This book gets closer to the magic that was `Beauty' than anything else I have ever read.I'm not going to hash out the plot again, (just go read it) but there are some elements of the book I feel like pointing out. For one thing, I think this is the first think McKinley had ever written that doesn't have a horse in it. Not even one. This, we all know, is about as likely as Tolkien writing a book in which his characters didn't randomly burst out into song or pages long poems. I think we can take this as a sign that McKinley is going for a decidedly different theme that the rest of her works. It is a growing-up story, but one for grown-ups. As for Sunshine's alter-ego partner-in-whatever rescuer Constantine (hottie) he does have as much stage presence as the Beast from `Beauty', combined slightly (in a good way) with that smith dude from `Spindle's End's stoicism, as well as the tenderness and charming quirks of Luthe. Sadly, McKinley pulls the Tor vs. Luthe trick again, though thankfully it's not as painful as it was in the original version. We can forgive Sunshine - and McKinley - for not being able to choose.All in all, I can sum it up on the quote printed on the cover by Mr. Neil Gaiman: \"Pretty much perfect.&quot;Robin McKinley is back!","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This novel was easy to read and enjoyable.

I have read so many history books that are such dry, monotonous chronicles of fact but not here. Ambrose makes history come alive and I believe that an argument could be made that this is the way history should always be written: with passion, excitement and life, as well as detailed historical information backed by tremendous research.Adding to the enjoyment of this book is Ambrose's deep knowledge of the American context at the time. He delves into Jefferson, into Washington politics and has various insights into the America of the time. We have a portrait of St. Louis at the end of the book, when Lewis was governor of the Louisiana territory. Also, the quotes from Lewis about the various indian tribes, mountains and rivers is superb.A superb effort that could only be written by someone with a truly authentic interest and love for his subject.Greg Feirman (gfire77@yahoo.com)","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"John Steinbeck's book was a book everyone should have to read to understand life during the depression.

What got me right from the start is how she wrote one of the last chapters first. It really got me into it right away.

I am glad to have finally found her. She is one of many British authors -- virtualy all now RIP who wrote wonderful books which tell great stories. Nothing sordid, boring or unpleasant, just stories told with humor, affection, lots of details, and sympathetic [mostly] protagonists. I've read some of her brother John's wonderful books and just reread THE THIRTY NINE STEPS and GREENMANTLE -- both are wonderful stories but just a tiny bit stilted and of their time. By contrast, sister Anna's books flow very smoothly and while not nearly as adventurous or dramatic, are every bit as great stories, if not better. I'm glad to have access to both authors!My only criticism of PENNY PLAIN is that the paperback version (print on demand?) is as large as a good sized magazine and a bit awkward. I found an old copy of PRIORSFORD (the successor volume) which is, by comparison, tiny.There have to be many such books that have, sadly, fallen out of print.

Poirot springs onto the pages fully formed. The retired Belgian police detective is quirky, not to say eccentric, but brilliant. He is that \"odd little man\" who uses \"the little gray cells\" to solve cunningly hidden crimes.Christie's typically complicated plot keeps the reader guessing along with Poirot's friend and narrator Lieutenant Hastings. Clue after clue leads us down one blind alley after another. Reading tip: If Hastings thinks he has figured something out, you can be sure he has it backwards. Christie adheres to this rule without exception - almost.By the way, I highly recommend the TV series in which David Suchet captures Hercules Poirot perfectly For example: (Agatha Christie's Poirot: The Definitive Collection). Albert Finney and Peter Ustinov have also given entertaining portrayals. Christie's Miss Marple, on the other hand, has been tackled by numerous actresses, but none has succeeded like Suchet has with Poirot. My favorite Marple is Margaret Rutherford who played the role in four movies made in the 1960s (The Agatha Christie Miss Marple Movie Collection (Murder at the Gallop \/ Murder Ahoy \/ Murder Most Foul \/ Murder She Said)).The Mysterious Affair at Styles is a delightfully entertaining mystery and a `must read' for any fan of the mystery genre. Christie's books, while they give a peak at sordid doings, are reliably comfortable and satisfying reads and as far from unsettling or noirish as one can imagine.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I bought this book along with my Breadman Ultimate because of the reviews here.

As a result I have refused to buy any sandwich bread.I have made pizza dough, wheat breads, country breads, white breads.

I haven't had any flour problems or liquid problems and have not had to stand over my machine and watch it mix.I have used the delay timer many times so that we could have fresh bread in the morning for lunches and toast.I would also like to add that wheat gluten was very easy to find.

Both books were well written, however at that time, the Cold War thriller genre seemed to be getting a bit stale.With movies like The Good Shepherd and The Company coming out recently, I thought I'd again read up on some Cold War fiction.Crossfire fit the bill perfectly. Again a well written book. The author really knows his subject matter. What is well known these days was cutting edge technology and method back in 1985. Very few people outside of the Special Operations community knew what a HAHO jump and LAP System were. Unlike a lot of similar type books written at that time (Rambo, Mack Bolan series), the characters in Crossfire seem real and authentic. They have weaknesses and vulnerabilities which the author often exploits.This book is very fast paced and keeps you interested.

Even in the essay in the back of my copy of the novel, critic Irving Howe admits that, \"The book begins to mobilize and direct large masses of tension which, until the last page, will make the reading of it an experience slow and grueling, a drain upon emotion.\" There is such a ludicrous amount of tension and tragedy in this novel that reading it is a stressful experience. In a way, it reflects how *good* the author is, because he made me care so much about the characters that I wanted to throw the book against the wall when one of them did something stupid. Finally finishing the novel created a feeling of palpable relief.Despite how stressful it was for me to read this book, I still appreciate its many qualities.

I purchased this book just after it rolled off the press and hit the bookshelves in the stores. \"Solitary\" was the book to have back nine years ago, a very hot selling book that generated many a tongue to wag and witch to curse over it's contents. Love her or hate her, Silver had the guts and courage to pick up the pen and write her books, especially this book!In reading some of the many reviews on this book I noted one thread that seems very obvious to those that were quick to tap on the keyboard.......the astute discriminating reader will note as I, that the statements made criticizing Silver were born out of the naysayer's lack of comprehension. Or, perhaps, their vehement dislike of Silver, or jealousy, and on and on....irregardless, the fact remains in their exuberance to get their \"Solitary Opinion\" out on, \"Solitary Witch\" they neglected to take the time to read and missed by a long shot. It seems \"Solitary\" is being judged by more than it's cover as is the author.I'm not posting this to review the reviewers so onward in my Solitary effort to write my review of \"Solitary Witch.\" Silver wrote the book of all books with this one. It's complete and I believe if one were to search thoroughly a kitchen sink might just be in the midst! It's a comprehensive book that chronicles the history and then explains in depth information regarding witchcraft. It could have used a better index as it's difficult to look up information and that can be frustrating. All in all the content speaks for itself and Silver does an eloquent job in writing, including her context. Her downfall is she writes to a teenage audience which I found to be a bit insulting to the intelligence of her adult readers. At times in her discussions she seemed to downplay our intelligence and in that regard she could have been served by a better editor at Llewellyn!I find this book to be useful and it has earned a place in not only the history of witchcraft but on the shelf next to the cauldron.

However, I was continually frustrated while reading this book because I felt that the author did not analyze very well the things she said. She would point out interesting comments made by couples seeking fertility treatment, but then give the same anaytical comments over and over again about the different couples' feelings. Also, I felt she was too biased and critical in her assessment of fertility treatment. It seemed like every couple (indeed, virtually everyone in the book was a married couple, very little representation from anyone else) felt the same way, ultimately -- disillusioned, doubtful about themselves, cynical about the process, and overall disappointed, even angry and bitter. This has not been my own personal experience, and I have a hard time believing that everyone in her large study sample was so dismal. It just wasn't a sophisticated, layered analysis. But it will probably be interesting to non-academics who would like to get a foundation for some of the negatives associated with infertility treatments, and with having problems with infertility.","sentiment_score":0.6},{"review":"How depression feels to a young woman trying to make it throught the obstacle course of life.

There were no decent source of theological books for a hundred miles and no good ones for 250. I was so desperate to read anything worthwhile in this Christian town.One day I saw Theodore Vriezen's _The Religion of Ancient Israel_. I had done much independent study with numerous little books on ancient near eastern religion, and had also become a staunch monotheist. This book summed up and excelled at all the scraps of information I had collected. It was a godsend.Since then I have many such introductions from the past 100 years including those of the &quot;giants&quot; both Jewish and Christian. When I want something I can feel safe with that truly describes the uniqueness of Israel's Yahwistic religion, I still reach for this old and beloved friend. I think this is the best intro out there especially for the student who does not know whether they are liberal or conservative theologically, or that they are supposed to be. The author is Christian but I do not see the typical bias as a Jew. It is my suggested first step. It also is a very positive book and explains Yahwism positively as well.I am referring to the 1967 edition of this book in my comments. I was drawn to the book again today while writing my own book, and I wondered if it were still available. I have not seen it in the past, but today it came up here at Amazon in a 2002 edition which I have not seen.Chapters are titled &quot;Israel's Religion Against the Background of the Religions of the Ancient East&quot;; Religious Life at about the Year 1000 (BCE)&quot; &quot;The Prehistory&quot; &quot;Yahweh&quot; &quot;The Victory of Yahwism&quot; &quot;New Forms of Life, State and Religion&quot; &quot;The Great Prophets&quot; &quot;Reformation and Downfall&quot; &quot;Regeneration and Recovery&quot; &quot;Centralization and Disintegration&quot;.

They are short; they are light and airy; they are pretty; they are fun. Teenagers could enjoy them. But these essays are fundamentally serious and scientific. Lewis is always on the hunt for the cosmic insight or deeper truth.His mind works metaphorically. He seeks interconnections. A recurring motif is to wonder whether social animals such as ants are like cells or more like human societies or perchance like the planet earth. Here is a celebrated quote:\"I have been trying to think of the earth as a kind of organism, but it is no go. I cannot think of it this way. It is too big, too complex, with too many working parts lacking visible connections. The other night, driving through a hilly, wooded part of southern New England, I wondered about this. If not like an organism, what is it like, what is it most like? Then, satisfactorily for that moment, it came to me: it is most like a single cell.\"This book was a bestseller around 1975 and won the National Book Award. Everyone seemed to be reading it. I read it. I recently ordered it again because I thought it might contain a tidbit for a video I was making called How To Teach Science. No such luck, but this is a book anyone could enjoy reading twice. Most of it remains in the present. It is finally the most readable of science books. Here are two more samples:\"My cells are no longer the pure line entities I was raised with; they are ecosystems more complex than Jamaica Bay. I like to think that they work in my interest, that each breath they draw for me, but perhaps it is they who walk through the local park in the early morning, sensing my senses, listening to my music, thinking my thoughts.\"\"Viewed from a suitable height, the aggregating clusters of medical scientists in the bright sunlight of the boardwalk at Atlantic city, swarmed there from everywhere for the annual meetings, have the look of assemblages of social insects. There is the same vibrating, ionic movement, interrupted by the darting back and forth of jerky individuals to touch antennae and exchange small bits of information...\"For anyone thinking of writing non-fiction, this is an ultimate text book. Apparently Thomas learned his style from Montaigne. Good luck on that.For anyone thinking of a career in science, Thomas shows the advantages of being partly a generalist, of being in your field and outside your field--the better to see some strange shadow or artifact that nobody else has noticed.Epilogue: I ordered a used copy from an Amazon dealer in the northwest USA. Stuck in the book was an old ticket to a music concert (George Winston, solo piano; Wikipedia says he has been called The Father of New Age Music). Date of ticket: 1985.

Read it as a thriller if you must - better to appreciate it as the idea that at some time all of us need at some time to 'come in from the cold'. Even if it is to ask for redemption on our deathbeds.

Amidst all this his experience is of ultimate calmness and freedom as he walks back and forth and even stands on his head high above New York while communing with a passing seagull.

Not only do the Settles give a thorough history of the background and organization of the Pony Express, they also present detailed accounts of the men who rode the horses and carried the mail, of the hundreds of stations along the route and the people who operated them, and of many of the trials and tribulations the company faced during the 18 months of its existence. Prior to the Pony Express, mail was carried from St. Joseph, MO, to California via a circuitous route through Texas and the Southwest; a more direct central route was proposed with the idea of cutting delivery time in half from 20 to 10 days. The Russell, Majors and Waddell freighting company reluctantly assumed the venture, which sparked excitement in the imagination of the public, but was never very profitable and caused the company to lose a great deal of money. The service lasted from April 1860 to October 1861, when the completion of the transcontinental telegraph put it out of business. The Settles do an excellent job conveying not only the nuts and bolts of the operation, but also the dramatic human side of the riders and the dangers and obstacles they faced. It's a great little book, one that will remain on my shelf for a long time to come.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Rachel is the awkward Lear sister.

The heroine is so spineless and insipid - a perennial college student who is shocked when daddy cuts her off at 31. As for the mystery - anyone could see where the author was going within the first 50 pages.I had the feeling that author London managed to obtain a British slang dictionary and used just about every cockney colloquialism and attributed them to Flynn in order to give the story some British validity. The biggest problem with that is that Flynn is upper class, and would never utter a cockney phrase, so the dialogue just grates on the nerves and becomes distracting.

On the one hand this book, dating from more than a century ago, imparts the kindly sensibilities the practice of law once had (and really, should still have).On the other hand, this book is masterful in its treatment of the process of cross examining witnesses.Second in significance only to the selection of a jury, the process of cross examination is key to winning jury trials. This is because admissions tendered by the opposing party can eliminate disputed issues or focus attention on credibility problems.Though Wellman often goes into great detail in explaining his examples, it's been my experience that new attorneys to the field cannot help but benefit from such complete treatments.In this way, Wellman leads by example both in relation to his gentility and his prowess.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I randomly selected Colin Channer's book &quot;Satisy My Soul&quot; from the library, not sure what to expect. Being a reader generally selecting books from historical authors, I tend to shy away from newer writers until they are seasoned or recommended to me by a critic I respect.I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor of Channer's novel. It contained a lot of the ingredients I search for in a writer. A good book should take you someplace, make you feel as if you are sitting in front of a warm fire if it is cold. I expect certain things from male authors and different things from female writers. I never expect a man to be able to &quot;write&quot; for a woman and vice versa. I get annoyed when either gender attempts to do this and fails. Channer took on this challenge and mastered it beautifully in &quot;Satisfy&quot;, he spoke as a women, for a women and retained the masculinity of the novel valid and true. I felt his hands on me, the sensuality of the novel was authentic and not copied and pasted from some place one might not be able to quite put their finger on... Channer's style for me was reminiscent of Carson McCullen (deep southern heat), or Tennessee Williams (intricate personalities - honest-true), Zora Hurston (a storyteller who can capture the heart of lovers). It is a blessing to have his exposure to Jamaica and the USA, for those unexposed, he can educate and entertain at the same time. I hope he stays this way - true to his style, going forward he will not miss if he does.Marcia","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"This book will change your life if you can grasp it.

After meeting with friends there, though many have died, he then drives southward through the length of California and then eastward through the southwest desert to Texas, Louisiana, and eventually up to Virginia before returning to New York.Carrying the reader along with him as he reconstructs this journey for publication in 1962, Steinbeck observes people and human nature, being careful not to draw conclusions about an entire area based on the individuals he meets along the way. Often it is their reactions to Charley, his aging standard poodle, which stimulates their conversations and allows Steinbeck glimpses of their thinking and ways of life. From the terminally gloomy waitress in Maine to the evil-looking mechanic in Oregon (who turns out to be the kindest and most generous of men), Steinbeck explores attitudes toward life (and strangers). Steinbeck's high school buddy (who almost comes to blows with him) shows him that you really can't go home again, and \"the cheerleaders\" of New Orleans, a group of white-supremacist women who taunt and scream obscenities at a tiny black girl integrating one of their schools, shows him how much work the human race still has left to do.As he travels in his truck with a house attached to its bed (a pre-camper invention), he notes the changing landscape, the disappearance of treasured aspects of the environment, and the growth of new trends--including the increasing popularity of the mobile home and the contemporary loss of \"roots.\" He is genuinely frightened by the Badlands, until night falls, when it becomes beautiful. He adores Montana, and he hurries through the almost blank southwestern desert where he learns something new about shooting. Though Steinbeck gets tired of travel before the end of the trip, he still manages to record signal moments which resonate with the reader.What elevates this book especially is the glimpses it gives of Steinbeck himself, a far more upbeat man than one would expect from novels likeCannery Row,Of Mice and Men, andThe Grapes of Wrath. His observations of life in the early 1960s capture the country at pivotal moments of history--the time of Sen. John Kennedy and freedom rides. In this respect, Steinbeck creates a time capsule for future generations and a picture of himself that lovers of his writing will treasure. n Mary WhippleThe Winter of Our Discontent (Penguin Classics)Tortilla FlatJohn Steinbeck, Writer: A Biography","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Really terrific grammar book.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the subject is so alien to me, as I'm sure it will be for most people, that sometimes I had to read a paragraph or two over and over until the light went on in my brain to grasp it, so it took me a LOT longer to read than most other books. That being said, it is the most amazing read. Once I understood how to do the exercises, which sometimes can be a little frustrating since you are not used to this kind, it really delivers what the author promises. I went through a break up when I was half-way through this book, and I have NEVER been able to control, soothe, or handle my feelings on break-ups without a lot of crying and a short depression period, so I tried one of the exercises a few times and I could not BELIEVE the results.

I refuse to. All the hype about it made me want to see what else was out there that was similar but well-written. This is a winner. I read the first Sleeping Beauty book, and while it was well-written, toward the end of it, I thought it was more torture porn than anything else -- not sexy, and then I couldn't get through the second book for the same reasons.\"Exit to Eden\" is different. The simplistic explanation would be that it's tamer than the Beauty books, but really, the big difference is the character development. It's almost a psychological case study of kink. What makes people gravitate toward it? Is it deviant? Can it exist within the realm of a healthy, loving relationship?Anne Rice is a genius with words. She manages to give Lisa and Elliot distinct, believable voices. The prose is both lyrical and conversational, and I never had a thought like, \"Oh, no one would really say that or think that in that vocabulary.\" So many passages worth underlining and rereading over and over. And it was HOT. Not to mention fun. I read somewhere that the rich are far more interesting to read about, and in this case I have to agree. Recession or not, I didn't mind hearing about the luxury at The Club or Elliot and Lisa's cushy backgrounds and disposable incomes.Now, this might be a judgment I can't legitimately make without having read the Fifty Shades trilogy, but I'll go ahead and say that after reading \"Exit to Eden\" and seeing a complex, fully developed story that has so many layers and a satisfying conclusion, I don't see how dragging out a story like that in Fifty Shades across three books could possibly be as fun to read when you can get so much more in this one quick, provocative novel.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Frank McCourt's \"Angela's Ashes\" is probably the easiest review that I have had to write since I have been doing such reviews in this space. Why? Frank McCourt's book of childhood memoirs is my story. No, not in the details of his life's story, or mine. But rather in how being Irish, being poor and being uprooted affects your childhood, and later. And those traumas, for good or evil, cross generational lines. McCourt, we are told as his story unfolds, was born in America of immigrants of the Diaspora after Irish independence who, for one reason or another, returned to the old country in defeat in the 1930's. As McCourt notes right at the beginning, that fact in itself provides a rather ironic twist if one is familiar with Irish history (at least until very recently). He is, in any case, thus a child of the Great Depression and World War II, the generation of my parents, as it was refracted through Ireland during that period. I, on the other hand, am a child of the 1960's, the \"Generation of `68\" here in America born of the dreaded Irish Catholic-English Protestant combination- and raised in an Irish Catholic enclave. Nevertheless the pages of this memoir are filled to the brim with the results of the emotional (and sometimes physical scars) of being \"shanty\" Irish in this world that hit home to this reader.That said, we did not share the terrible effect that \"the drink\" had on creating his dysfunctional family with his father's, Malachy McCourt, crazed need for the alcohol cure to drown his sorrows and his bitterness and the fact that his great moment in life was his bit for \"the cause\" (of Irish independence). A familiar story in the Irish community here and in the old country but my father seldom drank, although he too was constantly out of work and shared with Frank's father that same bitterness about his fate. He was uneducated, lacking in skills and prospects and as a \"hillbilly\" Protestant Southerner from coal country down in Kentucky. Thus, an `outsider' like Frank's father. That is the commonality that caught my eye (and sometimes my throat) as I read of Frank's youthful trials, tribulations and adventures. McCourt's ability to tap into that \"mystical\" something is what makes this a fine read, whether you are Irish or not.Throughout the book McCourt's woe begotten but fatally prideful father is constantly referred to in the Irishtown working class poor ghetto of Limerick (and elsewhere, as well, but the heart of the story is told from there) as having an odd manner. This reflects a certain clannishness against those from the North of Ireland (Dare I say it, then area the known as Ulster) and a sneaking suspicion amount that crowd of some alien (meaning English Protestant) heritage. As the book progresses that odd trait is transferred (by heredity?) to Frank in his various wanderings, enterprise and desires. What joins us together then is that odd manner that gets repeatedly invoked throughout the book. Frank survived to tell the tale. As did I. But in both cases it appears to have been a near thing.There is more that unites us. The shame culture, not an exclusive Irish Catholic property but very strong nevertheless, drilled in by the clannishness, the closeness of neighbors, the Catholic religion and by the bloody outsiders- usually but not always Protestants of some sort (as least for blame purposes- you know, the eight hundred years of British tyranny although very real to be sure). All driven by not having nearly enough of this world's goods. Every time I read a passage about the lack of food, the quality of the food, the conditions of the various tenements that the McCourt family lived in, the lack of adequate and clean clothing I cringed at the thoughts from my own childhood. Or the various times when the family was seriously down and out and his mother, the beloved Angela of the title, had to beg charity of one form or another from some institution that existed mainly to berate the poor. I can remember own my mother's plaintive cry when my brothers and I misbehaved that the next step was the county poor farm.And how about the false pride and skewed order of priorities? Frank's father was a flat out drunk and was totally irresponsible. From a child's perspective, however, he is still your dad and must be given the respect accordingly, especially against the viciousness of the outside world. But life's disappointments for the father also get reflected in the expectations for the son. The dreams are smaller. Here, the horizons are pretty small when a governmental job with its security just above the \"dole\" is the touchstone of respectability. Sean O'Casey was able to make enduring plays from the slums of Dublin out of this material. And Frank McCourt enduring literature. Thanks, brother.Note: The movie version of \"Angela's Ashes\" pretty fairly reflects the intentions of Frank McCourt in his childhood memoirs and follows the book accordingly, without the usual dramatic embellishments of that medium. The story line is so strong it needs no such \"touch-ups\". Particularly compelling is the very visual sense of utter poverty down at the base of Irish society in Frank McCourt's childhood.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I was surprised to discover how excellent this book was. I found the first few pages rather cheesy, but very soon London's character of Wolf Larsen, a brutal and all-powerful sea captain, changed all that. I found him one of the most disturbing and forceful characters in all of literature--a sort of Hitleresque beast, yet created almost thirty years before anyone ever heard of Hitler.Contrasted with Wolf Larsen is the main character, appropriately named Humphrey, a wimp extraordinaire--who falls prey to the power and control of Larsen, and slowly learns to find himself and his strength in Larsen's midst. However, for maybe the first thirty or forty pages of their interaction, the book seemed a bit over-philosophical, almost teenage in its grand discussion of \"life\" and \"morality\" and \"humanity\" and \"death.\" But then, somehow, Jack London gripped me anyway, and his created world of ultra-violence and distorted masculinity, where physical strength and personal force are everything, became all-too-real, all-too-believable, and all-too-powerful. I couldn't put it down. Kudos to Jack London!Unfortunately, though, the book peters out in the last few chapters. I don't want to give away the ending, but suffice to say that I felt London just couldn't sustain the story. Yes, intellectually the ending works, but emotionally it doesn't. It turned wooden--and false. I found myself bored at the end, and I hoped that London would somehow redeem it. Alas, he didn't.But in spite of the cheesy ending the book is still unique--and a worthwhile read. I have trouble imagining anyone writing such a book today.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Having two degrees in English, I was interested in this book because I, too, have found it interesting to see how people's writing styles give them away.The best chapter by far is the one on Primary Colors. I find it really hilarious that Joe Klein, a bitter disaffected liberal critic of Bill Clinton, behaved in the same way he accused Clinton of when confonted with strong circumstantial evidence of his authorship: first by trying to change the question while never actually denying his authorship, then wallowing in self-pity and lashing at his accusers, and finally owning up to it. Remember this when you hear Klein praised for his boldness and originality as a journalist ... he obviously felt that he was too big to be caught out by some pipsqueak English professor from Vassar.The introduction tempts us with many interesting literary mysteries, but really delivers a solid answer on only one: &quot;The Night Before Christmas.&quot; Mr. Moore, give up: I think it's obvious that Mr. Livingston is the true author (And perhaps would you disclose that you are a descendant of Mr. Moore, as I suspect?)I really wasn't that interested in the Sinyasky letters, although the methodology there is interesting. And the Unabomber chapter is interesting in that it delves more deeply into Kaczynski's intellectual reading and how the FBI could have caught him sooner if they had picked up on some of these things. But really, since we all know how it ended, there's no mystery and I really think Foster included it only to settle the score with Kaczynski's lawyer's experts who filed affidavits criticizing him.The Talking Points chapter, however, is actually more interesting than I would expect because there's obviously a bit more to the story than Monica saying she wrote it all (She wrote a page or two). Clinton's lawyers look like strong suspects ... still it's hard to prove that it was an attempt to suborn perjury.If Foster does a followup, he owes us a chapter on the JonBenet ransom note ... so obviously a fake with all the badass movie dialogue (and how many people start a note with &quot;Listen carefully!&quot;) But by whom? And was it written by whoever did the killing? (I'm not so certain that it was). The stuff on unresolved mysteries with conspiratorial overtones makes for better reading.

At first glance, Amy may seem to just another silly girl, especially in contrast to her still-waters-run-deep cousin Jane. But get to know her and there are many layers. The historical story in itself, with witty repartee, really bad bad guys, and all the other trimmings of the genre, is entertaining enough, but Willig frames it with the contemporary story of a grad student, Eloise, who is trying to find out the identity of the mysterious Pink Carnation. The elements of chick-lit, historical romance, suspense, and yes, just a bit of tongue-in-cheekiness, make this a delightful read for anyone looking for a fun escape from the mundane.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This &quot;dictionary&quot; is packed with information.

The children, three daughters (Edith, Deborah, and Laura), encompassed three different lives which Roger valiantly tried to embrace. Edith- committed to a family life with room only for her children. Deborah- committed to public service and the 'tenement children' in need of schooling. And Laura- committed to the \"new world\" and the modern woman.Instead of succeeding at understanding any one of his daughters completely, he seems to connect with them each only moderately and only on a few, isolated occasions.I am usually enamored by stories of a family growing old. This tale captured that nostalgia and sentimentality. However, while still pleasant to read, the story never seemed to grab me. As the first piece of literature to win the Pulitzer Prize for fiction (then referred to as the \"Novel\" award), I guess I was hoping for something more dazzling, or at least emotionally gripping (as were the two successive winners, The Magnificent Ambersons and The Age of Innocence).In all fairness, though, the characters are generally likeable and believable, and Poole does an exceptional job of highlighting some familial dysfunction, illustrating that although your feelings and thoughts might be clear, the relative roles that people take in a family can force even the patriarch to act in ways other than he thinks best.","sentiment_score":0.6},{"review":"This is a gripping book that is full of adventure and suspense.

They include such things as family vacations, Christmases, birthday parties, proms, baby photos, hunting\/fishing trips, as well as wrestling photos. The text covers the history of the Von Erichs, from father Jack Adkisson marriage to Doris Smith (losing his SMU scholarship in the process), to his early wrestling career (the reason for changing his name to Fritz Von Erich is not explained), to the birth of his six sons; five of whom he would outlive. The photographs reveal a happy, close-knit family, but tragedy always loomed.Fritz's first son, Jackie, drowned after a freakish accident when seven years old. His other sons followed Fritz's footsteps in the wrestling profession. In 1984, third son David, the tall cowboy, was preparing to wrestle for a world title against Ric Flair only to succumb to a ruptured intestine exacerbated by a rare stomach virus while wrestling in Japan. Kerry filled in for his brother and won the championship. Kevin, Kerry, and Mike were the most popular grapplers in the Denton County, Texas based World Class Championship Wrestling during the mid-1980s. The book, however, focuses on their family life and only briefly mentions their wrestling triumphs. Nemesis Gary Hart is pictured once but is not mentioned in the text.The book ends with Kerry's 1986 motorcycle accident and the 1987 suicide of Mike who suffered a personality change after barely surviving toxic shock syndrome. The book mentions that Kerry nearly lost his foot, of course, we find out later that Kerry did indeed lose his foot and used a prosthetic boot while in the ring. If one watches a post-accident Kerry match, one can see that one foot is stiff and does not flex at the toes. Many fans, however, did not know this until after Kerry shot himself to death in 1993. He had a stint in the WWF (the only Von Erich to do so) but the possibility of jail time for drug charges and the collapse of his marriage was too much for Kerry. His death followed that of youngest brother Chris, another suicide. Such was the so-called &quot;Von Erich curse.&quot; As the book points out, Christianity was very important in the Von Erich household and this faith is what keeps second son Kevin strong. He has retired from wrestling and is raising four children, some of whom may follow him in a wrestling career. Fritz passed away in 1997. The book is a wonderful tribute with intimate photos and stories that can make readers believe they know the family.

Although technically written in prose, this book is a poetic journey through Mahmoud Darwish's experience as a displaced Palestinian of the 1982 bombardment of Beirut. Darwish is one of the most renown poets in the Arabic speaking world, and even in prose his words and metaphors strike deep.The episodes in this book range from highly personal experiences of trauma to passionate political tirades - into the dream world and back to a reality that feels like a nightmare. It is a stunning look at the range of emotions of wartime trauma, from the sudden importance of simple acts like making coffee to the feeling of walking down the middle of an empty street hoping for the quick death of being caught by a shell rather than the slow death of being crushed under a building turned to rubble. The author's Palestinian identity adds the tension of being caught in the midst of a war, but with no true nationality or homeland.As the book progresses, the language and metaphors become increasingly edgy and jumbled, leading to a sense of increased confusion and inability to cope with the violence of circumstances. This book is not for the faint of heart (nor for readers who find symbolist poetry especially frustrating). But it is a stunning window into the Palestinian identity and the trauma of war - and even the passages that seem dense with obscurity eventually ignite into an overall sense of clarity.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This is such a wonderful book, and a perfect book for the military spouse and family!!

And, add to this story, there is a drug called JJ-180, which render the user to become so addicted and the side-effect of this drug will force the person to move through time (to the past or future, or even \"sideways\"). The plot of this novel is so twisted and flips like a hot coin to the point that the reader is unaware of what the story's going.While one is reading this book, many of Philip Dick's popular themes are evident (drugs, political suspicions, alternate realities, etc.).

It tells the story of an elderly amusement park worker, Eddie, and his voyage to discover his true purpose as he travels through the steps of heaven. Eddie meets 5 people that either played an important part in his life, or who was changed by him. He finds that they are all connected in some way and that their influence affected the person that he was. Each of these people has a different lesson to teach him as he continues his journey.We learn more about Eddie's life as he looks back on his experiences, the author describes certain significant birthdays, and his coworkers reminisce about their deceased friend. After encountering the 5 people Eddie at last realizes the meaning of his life.I highly recommend reading this book!

At least, one of the first for which he is best known.This book has everything...there is a great title, just for a start. then there are some great characters, who are very interesting. They are all on the hunt for Michael Hrubek, who has escaped from his psychiatric hospital and is now on his way to gain vengeance on Liz Atchesion, the teacher who testified at his murder trial...this book is typical Deaver. A book set over a short period of time, with twists and turns all the way. Deaver reveals the plot slowly skein by skein, and it unfolds before us like a tapestry. This is one of his most complex plots yet, and almost certainly his most character driven ever. it focuses much more on the relationships between all the characters, and how they act, than many of his others.there is a great plot, it's devious, inventive, exciting, and intriguing. typical Deaver, basically. you never, never, know where the book is going. there are some great revelations along the way, too. the dark and stormy night is a perfect setting for the book, and gives a great feel of calustrohpobia and isolatedness.However, the one thing i didn't like quite so much about this book was that, although it is an excellent thriller, it is a bit too long. Not a lot, but perhaps if it had been 50 pages shorter, and the pace a bit quicker, it would have been perfect, and definitely Deaver's best ever book.Why this book is such a muct-read is the absolutely fantastic twist at the end. It is the best twist Deaver has ever devised. it shies away from the usual twists to do with identity which Deaver usually uses (i.e. people not really being who you tihnk they are) but is much more than that. it is a superb twist, and it really blew my socks off. (even if it is delivered a bit weakly.) A stunning twist. I feel proud to say that i have read it, and hope that a little bit of his magic rubs off on me.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I think that its a really wonderful book.

Holton argues for a viewpoint based on the Enlightenment understanding with its emphasis on human reason and the scientific method. Holton traces the role of modern science in the formation of the philosophy of positivism in the thinking of many scientists and philosophers. From this Holton goes on to explore various ideas in the writings of Ernst Mach and Albert Einstein, two important contributors to modern mechanics and physics. Holton also considers the nature of rhetoric in the development of quantum mechanics and relativity theory. Thomas Jefferson who proposed a libertarian understanding of society and the role of science plays an important part in Holton's understanding of the nature of science and Holton sees him as offering an important program for science. Holton then considers various claims regarding the end of science including those made by Oswald Spengler and others. Finally, Holton considers the role of anti-science contrasting various positions that may be taken with regard to science and arguing for science against anti-science.The book includes the following chapters -Ernst Mach and the Fortunes of Positivisim - explains the role of Ernst Mach as a primary thinker behind the philosophy of positivism. Considers Mach's vigorous empiricism and pragmatism (relating Mach to other pragmatists such as C. S. Peirce) and examines Mach's contributions to mechanics. Examines the importace of Mach's thinking as a foundation for the philosophy of science based on empirical methods. Considers the thinking of such individuals and philosophers as Paul Carus, William James, Jacques Loeb, B. F. Skinner, and Philipp Frank explaining their understanding of empiricism and the philosophy of science as well as the development of pragmatism and psychology. Explains further the fruits of Mach's understanding as well as providing a biographical sketch of Mach and noting the role of the Vienna Circle as well as such thinkers as Rudolph Carnap, W. V. Quine, Niels Bohr, Karl Popper, and others who advocated the positivist philosophy which served as a framework for modern science.More on Mach and Einstein - considers further the relationship between Mach and Einstein as it concerned the foundations of physics. Notes that Mach early opposed the relativity theory. Explains some of the mathematics behind the relativity theory and notes the importance of Einstein's understanding of science.Quanta, Relativity, and Rhetoric - maintains that rhetoric played a role in science and in particular in the foundations f physics and the relativity theory as well as quantum physics. Notes the importance of experiment and the \"Gedanken experiment\". Notes the prominent role of Niels Bohr and Einstein in the foundations of physics.On the Jeffersonian Research Program - considers the libertarian theories of Thomas Jefferson and notes the importance emphasis that he placed on science and in particular the study of the natural world and the role of discovery. Explains the role of encyclopedias, the study and cataloguing of Indian languages, the Lewis and Clark expedition, and the Jeffersonian research project. Notes how a prominent role for science plays an important part in the Jeffersonian vision of society.The Controversy over the End of Science - notes the current fashion of maintaining that science has an \"end\" or has come to an end. Examines several perspectives on this question including the ideas of Mach who saw science as evolving in a linear direction and importantly the thinking of Oswald Spengler. Spengler was to propose a \"cyclicist\" view of history and in light of this considered the development of science as a product of Western culture. Spengler was to consider \"Faustian civilization\" in contrast to \"Dionysian\" works. He argued that while science was a product of Western Caucasian civilization, that eventually other races would take up science and overcome the West which was in decline. Considers the theories of Einstein with regard to science and notes the role of \"Einstein's God\". Explains Einstein's linearist views of science.The Anti-Science Phenomenon - considers the role of an emerging anti-science and anti-modern movement. Contrasts various perspectives on science and anti-science including real science, pseudo-science, superstition, and scientism (such as the unlimited dreams of technocrats as expressed in the Star Wars program). Considers the role of irrationalism and the prominence this came to take on for the ancient Greeks. Examines the issue of magic and folk belief. Considers various perspectives on science including the re-enchantment of the world and the view that science is usurping God's throne. Defines modernity and shows those who oppose its basic principles. Notes the deplorable state of science and mathematics education in modern America and argues for science. Provides an argument for the furtherance of science against anti-science.This book offers an interesting reflection on the philosophy of science and the role of science and society. I felt that it was particularly interesting in its consideration of Spengler's views.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"George Orwell did two supremely difficult things in this book: he wrote a brilliant polemic (unless you're a Communist, you'll know that polemics don't get any better).

I'll mention my favorite. Orwell saw that totalitarians will always hate beauty and try to drive it out of ordinary life. Why? Because beauty reminds people of what freedom feels like! This theme runs through 1984.Want to see Orwellian in action? Letting a far-left thinker like Erich Fromm write an essay for this book.

As a native Minnesotan, I especially appreciated reading the words of an \"entrenched\" Chicagoan on the unparalleled joy of the January thaw. When exposure to the elements of life is numbing, even capable of death, those moments when we can step unwrapped into that world and linger, and breathe deeply, are savored by Marty and craftfully rephrased in biblical and theological insight. Akin to Nouwen's _Wounded Healer_, this book is as encouraging to the caregiver as Brueggemann's _Finally Comes the Poet_ is to the preacher.

Take the words themselves \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...\". Now, put them next to \"...thus building a wall of separation between Church and State\". It is no less than amazing how this transformation could have happened. As the saying goes, \"Throw enough mud against a wall, some will stick\". Of course if there never was a wall, if one throws enough mud, it will make its own wall!We are all children of our own culture. When we hear things repeated again and again by people we love and respect, we will seldom question their veracity. Ideas get passed on from generaton to generation. They may change, but they do so slowly and the change is seldom noticed until the idea is totally transformed. That is what happened to our understanding as Americans of this part of the First Amendment. Going back to the beginning, as Hamburger does, makes a huge difference in our understanding.The book is great reading.

Only the hypersensitive or the irredeemably politically correct could possibly fail to enjoy this book.The naysayers make a big deal about the author poking fun at the native Africans, but fail to notice the amount of self-depreciation he also engages in. Ultimately, you get the sense of an inexperienced but well-meaning traveller who was completely unprepared for Africa but who realises it and sees the funny side of his own naivete. He is poking fun at himself as much as anyone else. And assuming that the tales he tells of African bureaucracy are true - and having experienced it myself, I'm inclined to believe them - why on earth should he not have a laugh about them?As a storyteller, the author has a real gift and I found the book difficult to put down.One star subtracted only because of the abrupt and wholly unsatisfying ending.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"i read this book in 4th grade took me about 2 weeks. i loved it it is my fav bookand i am currntly reading it again. i love wisconson","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"If you are too young to have read SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS when it first came out, be sure to grab this re-issue.

It's a non-fiction book dealing with some concepts that the layman may find difficult. However, it's told with enough clarity and wit that the reader should never feel overwhelmed by the mathematical and scientific terminology. Charles Seife does a fine job of balancing the explanations with the investigations.I really enjoyed reading this book, though I should point out that I already liked mathematical topics beforehand. Not that I was particularly gifted in mathematics in school, but the fun thing about reading books like this is that one can still think about and ponder the concepts without having to spend several hours a day doing repetitive busywork.Seife delves deep into the origins of zero. I found it fascinating to see exactly how some cultures simply had no need of zero and how others came to the idea with much resistance. The religious, philosophical, mathematical and scientific ramifications of this discovery are discussed and never fail to be intriguing.Although zero is what got on the cover and in the title, infinity plays a large part too. The book goes on a short history of major paradigm changes in philosophy, math and physics, pointing out where zero and infinity played major roles in tearing down old schools of thought and building new ones. Zero and infinity complement each other, and the history of zero would be incomplete without demonstrating how contemporaneous theories of infinity influenced it.I should also mention the book's tone. Although most people wouldn't think of a math text as a jolly read, this one would defy those expectations. You have to admire any book that includes the sentence: \"See appendix A for a proof that Winston Churchill was a carrot.\"Of course, humor and the whimsical flavor are only the icing. I'll remember a lot of the pure information presented. Some of it is meticulously analyzed, while some facts are just casually offered. Although this is a relatively small book, it feels very dense (in the best possible way). There's a lot here.I applaud Seife's research and presentation. While it would probably be difficult to make such interesting concepts boring, the writing here is anything but dry. This is the perfect gift for those of us with an interest in math, but without the intense background needed to survive a more mathematician-focused tome.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly must be read aloud to be fully appreciated.

The book focuses on the life of Billy Pilgrim, a simple man from the US midwest who is a soldier in WWII. The defining moment in his life is his presence , as a prisioner of war, in Dresden during the allied firebombing that killed over 100,000 people.The novel has a matter-of-fact attitude towards terrible events, in a sense subscribing to the notion of fate being inevitable. In a couple of different places it urges one to act on the things one can change, but then seems to say nothing can be changed. Vonnegut blends in science fiction to get this point across, as Billy Pilgrim is abducted by aliens who can travel through time and see everything, but can change nothing. What they do is choose to see only the good things in life.There is also a deep comedic sense in it, though one is prevented from laughing by the sheer horror of the situations. It is quite a different depiction of life, fate and war, a very innovative way of seeing the world. This is definitely an interesting book, one that is clearly written from an experienced point of view (Vonnegut was himself in Dresden during the firebombing).

In Orwell's dystopia, the state is all powerful; every aspect of life is controlled, down to --and especially-- the language itself. This is probably the book's greatest contribution to social theory --the idea that words and definitions have such a great influence on our thoughts. If we can't think of the word for something, we can't have a coherent thought about it. Orwell may not have invented these ideas, but he certainly dramatized them in an unprecedented manner. Another significant aspect of the novel is the perpetual warfare. The state is constantly at war, but allies and enemies constantly shift. The population is kept under complete surveillance by televisions that watch the viewer; and this was written years before internet cameras! The everyman hero, Winston Smith, gradually gets involved in a resistance movement that may or may not really exist. The paranoia of this scenario is total --no one can be trusted. In my opinion, many people have missed the point of this novel. ...I can't be sure of Orwell's purpose in writing the book, but to me it's not meant to be a realistic portrayal of any actual or even possible dictatorship. It's more of a theoretical model of a perfectly evil state --the antithesis, for example, of Plato's supposedly perfect society. ... To see the relevance of 1984, we have to focus on the techniques and mindset used by the state in that novel. Armies that are called peacekeeping forces; wars that are never declared against always changing enemies; a language of PC euphemisms and bureaucratic jargon -- these are facts of modern life. The fact that it hasn't gone to the extreme of 1984 and probably (and hopefully) never will does not in any way detract from Orwell's brilliant insights.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Pros: The author brought up many good points about the design process and how it has changed over the past few decades, which was a nice history lesson.

This text is for readers concerned with something more than the academic study of public policy and is aimed rather at those who accept responsibility for initiating action as policy-makers or making recommendations as policy analysts in the face of \"intractable policy controversies.\" The authors differentiate \"disagreements about fact\" from \"policy controversies\" and ariculate the notion of \"frame reflection\" as a requisite step in constructively addressing \"policy controversies.\"Just as Herbert Simon had highlighted a form of limited reason just before the mid-century mark that he characterized as \"bounded rationality\" and that Simon argued applied across all professional fields, so Donald Schon and his colleague Martin Rein highlight another form of limited reason that they believe applies across all professional fields as soon as one moves beyond mere analysis of facts to make professional recommendations. They characterize this limited form of reason as \"design rationality.\" While Simon's notion of \"bounded rationality\" may be well understood as emphasizing realistic cognitive contraints within which professionals act, Schon's notion of \"design rationality\" is likewise well understood as a limited notion of reason, yet one that emphasizes possibilities for exemplary practice.Frame Reflection provides a serious study of \"design rationality\" as applied to public policy practice. This text proceeds simultaneously at practical levels of analysis, theoretical levels of analysis, and fundamentally re-examines the relationship between theory and practice as applied to the public policy arena. It requires study rather than a simple reading. This book is for those scholars interested in a more inclusive conception of the public policy process (that is also useful to practitioners) and to that group of practitioners who are possibility thinkers and willing to work explicitly at developing further, their policy design skills as exemplary practitioners.The book interweaves distinctive bodies of literature\/levels of analysis that traditionally have studied separately empirical policy practice with levels of analysis that haved addressed the bearing of one's assumptional structures on policy consequences. The text argues that the former type of inquiry is necessary but insufficient for constructively engaging the latter. Indeed, the text argues that conventional academic approaches risk becoming misbegotten enterprises and that apart from \"situated policy learning,\" there is little hope for resolving \"intractable policy controversies.\" This book disputes inherited notions of properly ordered relations between theory and practice in relation to policy professionals much as Schon had made a similar argument with respect to a wider group of professional practitioners in his earlier seminal text on practical reasoning, The Reflective Practitioner.Frame Reflection was the final book written by Donald Schon before his death in 1997. It begins with an informative preface and introduction that should not be skipped. It defines its terms in the first three chapters on \"Intractable Policy Controversies,\" \"Policy Controversies as Frame Conflicts,\" and \"Rationality, Reframing, and Frame Reflection.\" In the middle three chapters it considers three case studies of \"situated policy learning\" that illustrate the dialectical character of policy-making, policy-making as a process of distributed design with several layers of associated complexity, and that illustrate via shortcomings and success in a distinctive set of cases, reflection's place in policy practice.In its concluding section the text focuses on lessons learned. The concluding section is entitled \"Toward Frame-Reflective Policy Conversation.\" It contains two chapters. The first of these, chapter seven, concludes with a close look at \"design rationality\" as illuminated in the public policy arena via study of these cases. The second, chapter eight, concludes with a stimulating analysis of \"Implications for Research and Education.\" While ten years after its publication, this text remains as yet under-represented in the literature of the field, this seminal text -- which in passing challenges tenets of both modern and so-called post-modern thought -- may prove far more enduring than much of the contemporary literature. Along with that other policy text requiring close study and independently developed by Giandominco Majone, Evidence, Argument, and Persuasion in the Policy Process, this text may represent the future of the field in the 21st Century better than any other policy texts of the 20th Century.Finally, as a pragmatic matter, as of this writing Frame Reflection is priced ($15) so that it ought to be attractive as a required or recommended text for anyone teaching advanced upper division or graduate courses on the public policy process or policy analysis. Particularly for undergraduates but including graduate students, even a cursory introduction to the tradition of practical reasoning (e.g. as contained in the Preface and a key chapter from Schon's The Reflective Practitioner) would be helpful for easing one into this challenging but deeply rewarding model of the public policy process and its corresponding modes of policy analysis. Having acknowledged the challenge, this book is highly recommended for any serious reader concerned with strengthening public policy processes. It is for those concerned with developing a type of reflective and analytic skill that is helpful for policy-makers or analysts when concretely engaging situated policy controversies.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This book is an easy read and yet is packed with useful and informative material. My copy is now dog-eared on almost every other page as I marked the key points to share with colleagues and to follow-up. The contents may be common sense and obvious if you are a church consultant or have many years experience in managing church affairs, but they can also be viewed as being insightful and brilliant to those of us new to this challenging topic. I highly recommend this book to every board and staff member of a church, whether you are considering hiring a new staff member or simply want to do more\/better with those you have. This book will help you hire better, manage your existing staff better and make the most of the volunteers you have to support your staff (including board members). The advice in this book would cost thousands of dollars from a consultant and you can get it for about $10.

Please tell us the real story.\" To me this book was a revelation, as much for the data inside as for the author, whom I would describe as another Thomas Sowell, for the clarity and immediacy of his speech. After reading this I am more than ever convinced that the love that elite America has always felt for Europe is one of the main causes of the political and social divides inside American society today: Like an extra-marital affair with a high class prostitute. A fatal attraction.I would recommend to the reader that he combine the reading of this book with Dick Morris's Catastrophe, for a more detailed analysis of how insiders to the regime play their lucrative parts in Obama's America. Thus you get to understand the big picture as well as the day to day money-dealings inside the US regime.Here's all you want to know about the world, socially and politically. There is no better book to travel all over the world with and understand how the common folks in those places must feel.The nature of our western regimes:\"The most economically profitable thing you can do, whether in Europe or in Argentina, or China or Chicago, is to worry less about producing than about building a profitable relationship with the regime. Because exchanging economic privilege for political support is the essence of modern government.\"\"Regimes have added a new twist ... that government must depend on science, which dictates that people must surrender to their betters plenary powers over where and how they live, how much and what kind of energy or even food they consume, in order to 'save the planet' from human habitation's effects.\"Our military:\"The change began in the 1950's, as the social groups that make of the regime began to look down on their fellow citizens' revulsion to communism ... our regime, scornful of the traditional military goal of victory, became accustomed to using the armed forces in ventures from the Balkans to Iraq that were neither war nor peace, that were more obviously related to regime goals than to American interests -but that got a lot of people killed nevertheless.Russia\"Mafia oligarchies such as post-Communist Russia, where the rulers regard others' property as a threat to their own and where friendship is restricted to families.\"Singapore\"defenseless free ports, like Singapore, where the rulers thrive within systems of law and low taxes that encourage large numbers of people to think of nothing but making money.\"China\"Business in China consists effectively of granting and using the privilege to hire labor for next to nothing. The system runs ... on the expectation that various officials will be content with the bribes they have received.\"Europe\"All Europeans accept their roles as subjects -as entitled consumers of government services. The real citizens of Europe, from whom power and to whom privilege flow, are society's corporations, whether big business, unions, political parties, or the complex of bureaucrats and the interest groups they finance.\"\"It is difficult to imagine Europeans nowadays offering their lives for their country. Contemporary Europe's way of life has been possible only because it was protected by the United States.\" And here's where the US could have had the upper hand in its dealings with Europe, but dismissed it.Analyses of other countries like Switzerland, Sweden, Japan, Mexico, Italy, etc. are all here, and every one of them is a travelogue to be relished, never boring and always enlightening.How come the demise of Catholic Europe since WWII, and so fast?\"In Catholic Europe, the Christian Democratic movement, the principal reaction to militant liberalism, gave up advocacy of Christian causes, refused to take clear stands on the major issues of the day, immersed itself in day-to-day administration, and died. Throughout the European continent, then, politics has trained people to forget the soul.\" Sound like the story of Republicanism since... Lincoln?Germany in a few slides:\"In their most vigorous years, these people lived by Nazi standards. They spent their middle age trying to approach the ideals of the Adenauer republic -bourgeois respectability ... their old age has been passed in a country characterized by sex shops, welfare and environmentalism, where the ways of the Adenauer republic are ridiculed. Their last impressions must be of Muslim neighbors whom it is dangerous to displease.\"How the regime works\"Scientific management, its success depending on maintaining a pretense of neutrality on the issues, but there is \"massive evidence that those who hawk certain kinds of social or environmental policies in the name of science are partisans of those policies.\"\"Today's tycoons have more power over ordinary people than the trusts of a century ago, because while the old robber barons had to do the robbing themselves, today's CEOs can count on the government to do it for them by manufacturing markets for them, by tailoring rules that stifle competition, and by bailing out their blunders.\"\"The regimes rule more by fashion ... than by statute. It defines itself by its icons and taboos.\" Sounds like paganism and superstition are here again.The way to get rich:\"The new path to riches is knowing what the government wants ... though lawyers produce nothing, they are paid more than engineers because government makes their services really more valuable ... such high salaries are passed on to the public through higher prices.\"Affirmative action:\"is about neither race nor sex. It is about politics ... it is about patrons and clients ... about adding to the power of those who already have power and obliging those under them to build the personal political relationships that override objective criteria and immunize against New Age accusations.\"You get a lot of information here, from almost every corner of the world and every facet of society. If a businessman came from outer space, this would be the book he should need. And that seems also as far as we -rather serfs than citizens- are from the ruling bureaucrats in the West.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I've got copy 4066 of this sumptuous (and reassuringly?) expensive package and I thought this review should really detail what you'll get for your money.ONE: An oversize Kodak color film box, nineteen inches high by sixteen wide and three deep, this is a big facsimile of the box that De Dienes kept some of his Marilyn prints in. The package weighs twelve pounds and will hardly fit any bookcase. The inside has recesses for the two books and one booklet. Black silk tape allows for easy access of the contents.TWO: A large, beautifully designed and printed, 240 page book of Marilyn photos printed on thick paper. Although the printing screen is not the highest (150 dpi) the photos leap off the page, especially the full-page color ones. Many of these photos seem to be very private shots of Marilyn that De Dienes took during her career (a few show her with other people, a hairdresser and bookseller). Several at the back of the book show Marilyn's face montaged into clouds or surrounded by celestial bodies. Between the photos, printed in silver ink and in a large typewriter font, there are excepts from De Dienes memoirs. Also printed in silver are smaller photos with his hand-written captions.THREE: A booklet with twenty-four, one to a page, magazine covers featuring De Dienes photos of Marilyn. Seventeen of them are European titles. Predictably, great photos are weakened by logos, cover lines and generally poor cropping. I thought this booklet was rather disappointing in its production.FOUR: The 608 page facsimile of De Dienes manuscript and composite book. I think this is the most fascinating item in the box because of the production problems. The original pages were typed on one side of a sheet of ordinary paper and this facsimile is on similar weight stock so that the back of each page has some text showing through, as the original (There is a production problem here though, the paper rightly has text show-through but the photos do as well, on the original paper only the white back of the photo would have been visible). Although the manuscript was in black and white it has been printed in four colors to create the aged paper look and the few handwritten numbers in green and red that De Dienes wrote on the photos. You can see all of his corrections and deletions to the manuscript and read the comments he wrote about the various contact prints of Marilyn and other printed ephemera he stuck on back of each page.The original composite section has a hundred pages (it becomes two-hundred pages in this facsimile) of cut-out contact prints which De Dienes stuck on the typewriter paper, again they are reproduced in four-color black because of the occasional handwritten colored numbers, even the image of the punched file holes on each page is reproduced. Hundreds of these contacts show how he photographed Marilyn and you can see how dozens of shots were taken of which only one or two were probably published. Most of these images have never been seen before and certainly never in the form that they are presented here.Overall I think the Marilyn Box is an amazing production package. A world famous visual icon is presented in a unique way.*** FOR A LOOK INSIDE click customer images under the contents photo.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"wo side effects from reading &quot;Inside the Works&quot; are blindness, resulting from the weird font, and nausea, resulting from horror so hardcore that you want to wash your hands after putting the book down. Edward Lee along with Tom Piccirilli and Gerard Daniel Houarner, are the writers featured in this &quot;3-way collection of hard core horror&quot;. All three have a kind of genius for writing almost pornographic horror that is intense, gut-wrenching, and scary, yet strangely compelling. Although these stories are like skinny dipping in a pool of blood and other bodily fluids, I kept getting the sensation that I was reading something NEW and FRESH. Edward Lee's novella The Pig was drenched in torture and mutilation but amazingly enough these elements were used in service of a great story rather than the other way around! Also worthy of mention i! s that many of the situations in the story had me laughing out loud! Counterbalancing Lee is Tom Piccirilli, whose five short stories were grim little journeys into hellish back alleys of New York.

Positing the existence of a 36th Vermeer painting, the book explores the power that art can exert upon us to the point of obsession.The book is essentially 8 different yet interrelated short stories about the circumstances of the historical owners of the painting in question, the Girl in Hyacinth Blue. The transition between stories is accomplished through a series of interlocutory vignettes concerning the circumstances of Vermeer's life and the actual creation of the painting. Although I actually like Vermeer's work, I knew next to nothing about his personal life and found these passages quite interesting.On the whole I found the stories quite compelling as well, though there were a few that would have benefited from a bit more development and a more thorough presentation.However, on the whole I found the book quite riveting and entertaining. In the end I was left wishing the painting did in fact exist-even without knowing what it actually looked like--the cover illustration aside-I felt a bit obsessed with it myself.

Professional critic Diana Saenger shares her recipe for success in this competitive field by including such important ingredients as how to analyze films and other venues, the do's and don'ts of interviewing celebrities, techniques for marketing written work, and how to handle rejection. The book's resource bibliography and list of professional organizations are added attractions which should prove useful not only for novices, but also for writers already in the business. Quotes from various stars, directors, and writers illustrate important points and make the book a delight to read. For example, Djimon Honsou (&quot;Amistad&quot;)tells the author, &quot;Destiny isn't waiting until something happens to you. To have destiny, you have to get up from the seat of your pants and make it happen.&quot; Advising wannabe entertainment writers to adopt this statement as a kind of mantra, Saenger emphasizes the time and effort required to reach this goal. But the rewards involved are also covered thoroughly --- including access to free movies, plays, videos,etc. and the excitement of interviewing celebrities. Thankfully, readers are warned not to quit their day jobs before jumping into a full-time entertainment writing career. &quot;Did you expect to have fun and get rich too?&quot; Saenger asks. Because it's difficult to make a living as a writer, this important advice deserves more attention than it gets here. Still, the author does explain carefully that most writers will have to work without pay for awhile to get started. &quot;Everyone Wants My Job&quot; should be added to reading lists in career counseling courses everywhere.

I love the way S.K. goes from character to character, from teenage years back to present day. Sometimes its hard to tell what's what but it makes everything flow that much better, and you grow to love and care for each character. Billy, the wise, gifted writer and leader of the group, Stan is soft hearted and slightly wimpy, Richie with all his voices adds laughter and humor to the tale, Eddie with his powerful inhaler or battery acid who is strong mentally even if he isn't strong physically, Mike who looks out for everyone and adds color to the group in more ways than one, Beverly with her beauty and strength, and finally Ben whos weight never gets him down. The 7 become a kind of magical circle of power, a witches coven of sorts that fight IT as children and later as adults. Only children can really see IT, with its horror, its blood splattering terror, and its orange pom poms. As a child I was always afraid of clowns, and reading this story it brings the terror back and throws it in my face.

Not only is the pacing and style different, but also his male characters have fully embraced their feminine sides to the point of being almost wimpy (even a minor character, a massive weightlifter, can freely admit to his fear of surgery). Perhaps this is to enhance his female protagonist's machoness, perhaps it's a slam at sunny California from the security of his snowbound Minnesota; either way it's a noticeable departure from his stubborn, tough-as-nails, manly-men characters.Sandford has structured The Night Crew like a standard mystery, where the reader doesn't discover the identity of the killer until the heroine does. This means a lot of dead ends, as every last red herring has to be tracked down before the case cracks wide open. This too is a departure from Sandford's standard fare.As with any \"introductory novel,\" Anna Batory's story is packed with background information about its characters. Combined with the brief story segments, accommodating all the backstory makes for some very choppy, occasionally disoriented reading. I'm sure some of this is intentional, but at times it all became a little overwhelming. Combined with a lackluster serial killer (there's really nothing to him beyond general creepiness and a generic FBI profile) and several noticeable plot holes (How is Anna's neighbor able to check up on Creek who's registered in the hospital under an alias? Why aren't suspects immediately written off when they lack the requisite facial damage?), and The Night Crew becomes a run-of-the-mill story, rather than a masterpiece.For all its shortcomings, though, The Night Crew is still an enjoyable read. Television is full of shows that didn't gel right away or took awhile to find an audience. Should Sandford choose to send Anna, Creek and company off on another investigation I wouldn't hesitate to pick it up.","sentiment_score":0.6},{"review":"Although rough in topic, this is a brave and ambitious project for this young author.

Though there really isn't a date given, I pictured it perhaps in the early 1920's, though the depiction of the automobile as some kind of strange novelty probably sets it in the early 1910's.Perhaps it's a reflection on myself, but I enjoy stories about ordinary people who are stuck in a rut or who have lived their lives having never followed their dreams and who are given one last chance to shine.The characters and antics are outrageous, yet likable in a strange way. And the story reads pretty quickly.While reading this book, I pictured elements of the 20's, 50's, and 80's. In fact, I think they should re-make a movie of this book and set it in a &quot;timeless&quot; setting.Overall, if you're not prejudiced against reading a book written in the 1920's, I'd recommend it.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"\"Memoirs of a Giesha\" is a glimpse into the past and a culture that has been changed by time and circumstance.A child from the country is sold into virtual slavery through the influence of a well-meaning neighbor. Disheartened, lonely and oppressed, she is uplifted by the kindness of a man she meets in a Kyoto park. His action inspires her to seek the life of the geisha. Her goal is frustrated by the cruelty of one geisha but aided by the kindness of another.After becoming an apprentice geisha she meets again the businessman who first inspired her. Obsessed with him, she seeks to devote herself to charming him. Oddly, he seems inclined not to recognize her and to ignore her while his taciturn and war-damaged associate and several others compete for her company and, later, in an unusual auction, for her virginity.Despite the fact she is grateful to Nobu, the associate, for his kindness-which extends to his having rescued her from poverty and, possibly, death in World War II-she is not willing to become his mistress and devises a scheme which sours his opinion of her.Though it's fiction, Golden has done a remarkable job of bringing reality to a way of life few in the West can imagine.

I bought the newer edition because I wanted to read the added Afterword, describing Hampl's visits to the post-communist Czech lands. As a native Czech (a dual citizen of the US and the Czech Republic) and a memoirist, I was curious to read how her stories, her feelings, and her impressions matched up with those I had, returning to my native land after 40-plus years in exile. When I first came, after the Velvet Revolution, I had mixed feelings about people who had been, or whom I had suspected of having been, members of the Communist Party. After all, my parents and I had to escape on foot across the border from the Reds, and these people had stayed. Now, some 22 years after the Velvet Revolution, it was Ms. Hampl who expressed my feelings more eloquently and insightfully than I've been able to do in my own writing. She wrote:\"...I understood finally that I had no business judging any of it or any of them... The Czechs may want to be part of 'the West,' but they know the West -- me with my blue American passport -- can't be part of their tangled history, their inner family.

The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less.Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked.

I wait for the next mammoth instalment in Robert Caro's outstanding biography of Lyndon Johnson.Reading any volume of Caro's biography is an event and the third volume, which deals with Johnson's years as a US Senator from Texas, is excellent. Caro continues with his theme of how Lyndon Johnson's unrelenting quest for political power led him to come to dominate the most conservative, elitist branch of US government over the space of a few short years. As anyone who has read the previous volumes will know, Johnson's methods were no less audacious, conniving and breathtakingly blatant as in the earlier stages of his career.Caro documents Johnson's service in the Senate in detail, but not before he has provided the reader with a comprehensive history of the institution itself and of some of the principal players, like Georgia's stately Richard B. Russell, who would play integral roles in Johnson's continued rise to power. Such studies are, however, essential if the reader is to get a true understanding of just how amazing Johnson's rapid rise to power was and he used it to secure passage of the first civil rights legislation since Reconstruction.As with Caro's previous books, the research is outstanding in its detail and the writing is enthralling in its style. This book is not so much a political biography as a saga of one man's acquisition and manipulation of political power. At over 1100 pages, newcomers to Caro's work may well be put off. However, they should not be discouraged - the book is almost as &quot;un-put-downable&quot; as a bestselling thriller.&quot;Master of the Senate&quot; continues the pattern set by Robert Caro in his two previous volumes. As I have said in my reviews of those two works, this is political biography at its absolute finest and I recommend it without any hesitation whatsoever.

In \"Saucer - The Conquest\", Coonts, one of the kings of the \"military novel\", creates a light-hearted plot that has his characters romping from the Moon and back. Picking up about a year after the conclusion of \"Saucer\", the plot begins with the protagionists from the first book, pilot Charley Pine and archeologist Rip Cantrell, parting company. Charley (or Charlotte) takes a job as a pilot under the employ of Pierre Artois, a French millionaire with designs on the creation of a colony on the moon. Rip stays behind with his uncle Egg and \"pines\" for Charley.After her first trip to the moon on one of Pierre's French space shuttles (yeah, right), Charley discovers that Pierre's real motivation is not in establishing a lunar colony, but rather a base from which he can use an anti-matter weapon against the Earth. His ultimate goal, of course, is world domination as he sees himself as the next Napoleon.When Rip senses trouble, he takes the flying saucer that he and Charley used in the first novel of the series (and subsequently donated to the National Air and Space Museum) and heads out to help Charley. Without revealing too much of the plot, let me just say that there's action aplenty (especially the aerial dogfight between Rip's saucer and another saucer that's introduced in the book) in the last half of the book as the heroes fight for the Earth's survival.My only real criticism of the book is the format in which in was printed. Printing it in the \"large\" paperback format was a downright dirty trick for those who had already invested in the series. Come on St. Martin's Press, doubling the price by printing the large format was a blatant attempt to simply gouge the consumer.Not with that being said, the reader needs to go into this book with the idea that it is a wild ride solely based in fiction. That could be tough for some Coonts fans to take because most of his earlier works are at least rooted in some fact. If the reader simply looks at the \"Saucer\" series as Coonts chance to play a little bit, then it will become an enjoyable read. Certainly, fans of the '50s and '60s Sci Fi \"B movies\" will enjoy the two books. (And probably a third that seems to be on the horizon.)With that being said, it's still a good (and fast) read and should be picked up by anyone who enjoyed \"Saucer\".","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"After finishing this book I was reminded of a beautiful grand house - if you take it in its entirety, you can't help but admire it. Within, there may be some rooms that leave something to be desired, but the overall effect is breathtaking. So it is with this book. Fitzgerald manages to write a story about a relationship that manages to be acerbicand tender at the same time. Like the other traditional inheritor of the `Great American Novelist' title, Hemmingway. Fitzgerald combines a genius for writing wonderful character insights with great `background painting' - some of his descriptions of settings are truly masterpieces. Even the `extras' - they don't have anything to do with the story so it is hard to call them characters - get wonderfully drawn descriptions. I feel that this book truly captures its age and place.And the added bonus - this is a wonderful insight into a relationship built on the worst of foundations slowly but surely heading to its end, told to us from various viewpoints. I don't know much about Fitzgerald's life, but if this is semi-autobiographical as literary critics say, you have to feel sorry for all that were involved in the real life events. Dick and Nicole are really caricatures of the Americans of their generation that lived the high life in Europe, and yet could never quite put their finger on what is was that they were actually meant to be doing.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"EXCELLENT BOOK, RECIPES ARE WELL WRITTEN AND EASY TO FOLLOW.

Rachel Verinder, heir of Colonel John Herncastle, who murdered to obtain the jewel during the battle of Seringapatam, inherits this possibly cursed treasure on her eighteenth birthday in 1848, only to have it vanish before she can put it into the bank. Drawing on sensational details--three Indian \"jugglers\" who approach the house to perform a juggling act, the disappearance of the jewel from an Indian cabinet during the night, the certainty that the theft was an inside job, a housemaid with a criminal past, and a paint smudge on night clothing--Collins creates a haunting atmosphere and builds suspense.Telling the story is Gabriel Betteredge, the house steward, a man who has been asked to set down his recollections by Franklin Blake, who was present in the house at the time of the jewel's disappearance, and who is in love with Rachel Verinder. Betteredge is a delightful story-teller, providing details, humor, and suggestions about what happened with a conscientiousness that makes him a reliable narrator. As the story becomes more involved and the characters take on lives of their own, other narrators take up the story where Betteredge leaves off and provide new information.The second narrator, Miss Drusilla Clack, Rachel Verinder's cousin, is a \"poor relation\" who is also a religious fanatic, and her commentary and her behavior provide some of the funniest moments in Victorian literature. Collins's use of humor, in fact, is one of the ways in which he surpasses his friend, Charles Dickens, in keeping an audience entertained. Franklin Blake, rejected by Rachel, provides additional commentary about the events, as do a doctor and his assistant, a local police sergeant and his investigator, the family lawyer, and a traveler to India. The use of multiple points of view is one of the great advances Collins makes in the history of the novel. The fact that this is widely regarded as the first of the great mystery novels (though not dependent on a single detective) is another plus.Overall, the novel is surprisingly modern in its ability to appeal to a wide audience. Collins is adept at manipulating his readership and in keeping suspense high. His characters are often engaging and frequently humorous, and in its ability to deal with social issues of the day, the novel provides pertinent commentary about colonialism, religious fanaticism, and class issues. Collins never forgets, however, that he is writing to entertain, and in this he succeeds admirably. n Mary WhippleThe Woman in White (musical tie-in) (Penguin Summer Classics)","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"This is a review of the Kindle formatting of \"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\" I really enjoyed the story itself, but the Kindle layout could really use some work. Like a lot of free public domain ebooks, this one isn't exactly user-friendly. The lack of a title page doesn't bother me, but this book is also missing a table of contents. If you're reading this for a class or a reading group, that missing table of contents might be a deal breaker. Additionally, while you can always refer to line numbers, this book lacks pagination. Again: I realize this isn't something that's going to bother everyone, but if you need to refer to page numbers in an essay, you might be in trouble if you use this copy.If you're like me and you're interested in reading this book just for fun, page numbers and a table of contents probably don't matter much to you. However, I think everyone can agree that things like page breaks and proper spacing between chapters vastly improve one's reading experience. That's the real rub: There are none. Paragraphs sit immediately atop one another like a great wall of text. Chapters receive the same treatment and are only demarcated by plain text- no bolding, no new section, nothing. The whole effect is not only visually unappealing, but just plain annoying.So the layout of this Kindle edition isn't great, but this book isn't all bad. For one thing, it's free. You get what you pay for formatting-wise, but it's a fantastic story and it's yours forever at absolutely no cost. Plus- and this is also big- this ebook isn't riddled with spelling errors and typos like a lot of the other public domain books available on the Kindle. In sum, while the formatting is annoying, the book is still totally readable.","sentiment_score":0.6},{"review":"This book takes you through this yogi's amazing life experiences.

Sub-titled, \"The World War II Adventures Of A Legendary Escape Artist And `Cooler King'\". St. Martin's Press, New York 2005.William Ash was raised in Depression-Era Texas, where he learned the hard way that life is rough. Those lessons stood him in good stead when he became an expert escape artist from the POW camps of Nazi Germany. As he said, on page 22, his \"twilight actives\" prepared him by: \"...being an unwelcome nonpaying passenger, learning how to avoid the attention of guard dogs or the authorities, sharing food and political discussions with men just as badly off as myself , and sometimes just learning to laugh in the face of everything the world could throw at me.\" He calls his younger days as \"An Apprenticeship In Escapology\".Building on the first two chapters, he then relates the story of his decision to fly for the RAF, his aviation training, first in Canada, and then in the actual combat zone in England during the Blitz. Because of his flying for the RAF, he had to renounce his American citizenship. There are vivid descriptions of London under the bombs, with destruction and fire seemingly everywhere. Then comes the chapter that changes everything: \"The Day Of Reckoning\". (page 85): \"I cut my engine, since it was clearly full of holes and not doing much good\".Shot down over occupied France, William Ash is helped by some French farmers, who struggle with his high school French but help him to find the underground resistance. He is, however, captured in Paris in June 1942, but not before he was able to enjoy the city of Paris as any tourist would do. The bulk of the book, from page 101 (the capture) to page 307 (his return to London) deals with his experiences with German Prisoner Of War system. The Gestapo threatens to shot him as a spy, as he is in civilian clothes, etc. He is \"rescued\" from the Gestapo by the Luftwaffe, as the German Air Force claimed all air force type POWs as their responsibility. Ash then relates his travels from camp to camp, through bombed out German cities, and finally arriving in a POW camp about as far East as the Reich went. His escape attempts are recorded in detail and his punishments, each time he was re-captured, made him, as the book flap recounts, the \"real-life `cooler king'\".

Told from different points of view, the text is a tapestry weaving Bertha's story with Edward Rochester's early life. Like the seaweed the book is named for, the structure floats in and out of artistic consciousness as though on a sea of many unwritten stories.Although some might argue that &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea,&quot; detracts from &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; I feel that Jean Rhys gives us a fuller understanding about the cultural historiography that produces &quot;great literature.&quot; As a champion for the silenced voices, Charlotte Bront herself was all too aware of societies' injustices.

The narrator joins a bus queue in a perpetual sunset kafkaesque town and takes a trip to heaven where any can stay and go to the mountains if they repent and trust. Lewis hits the mark at describing our fallen psychology. As Dante had Virgil as guide so our narrator has Scottish author George MacDonald along on the tour. MacDonald trying to explain the choice of the lost says: \"Milton was right,\"... \"The choice of every lost soul can be expressed in the words, 'Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven.' ..... There is always something they prefer to joy --- that is, to reality.\" The people from hell are shades as they all quickly discover on leaving the bus. The grass, trees, and even the water are solid and the shades from hell leave no impression. Conversely the new environment does effect them, one example being that rain drops would blast holes in them like machine gun bullets. The heavenly region they visit is much larger than hell although they don't realize it. \"All Hell is smaller than one pebble of your earthly world: but it is smaller than one atom of this world, the Real World.\" The reason hell is so small is that it is so full of mostly nothing. The insistence on self will leads eventually to the person becoming more and more unreal. The narrator, who is really Lewis of course, asks MacDonald about his being a Universalist, that he talked in his books as if all men would be saved. Paraphrased MacDonald says something like: Doctrines such as universalism or even predestination may be true in eternity from God's perspective and paradoxically not true in time where freedom operates and the choice of ways is before you.

He was also the most noteworthy scholar on the \"life of Jesus\" of his day, and his 1906 bookThe Quest of the Historical Jesusis one of the few absolutely \"indispensable\" works in the field (which both conservatives and progressives agree about). In \"Quest,\" after surveying all of the various \"lives of Jesus\" that had been written until 1906, Schweitzer gave his own views as well.This 1930 book expanded his earlier book, Paul and His Interpreters. He states in the Author's Preface, \"My methods have remained old-fashioned, in that I aim at setting forth the ideas of Paul in their historically conditioned form... Just because Paul's mystical doctrine of Christ has more to say to us when it speaks to us in the fire of its primitive-Christian, eschatological, manner of thought than when it is paraphrased into the language of modern orthodoxy or modern unorthodoxy, I believe I am serving in this work the cause not only of sound learning but also of religious needs.\"He writes, \"The fundamental thought of Pauline mysticism runs thus: I am in Christ; in Him I know myself as a being who is raised above this sensuous, sinful, and transient world and already belongs to the transcendent; in Him I am assured of resurrection; in Him I am a Child of God.\"He concludes on the note, \"In the hearts in which Paul's mysticism of union with Christ is alive there is also an unquenchable yearning for the Kingdom of God, but also consolation for the fact that we do not see its fulfillment. Three things make up the power of Paul's thought.

Emma and Pride & Prejudice are equally extraordinary novels and I don't think one has to engage in a tug of war over which is best: each has its charms and delights. The story of Anne Elliot, who enters into an engagement at age 20, only to succumb to family pressure and break it off, is 28 and alone when we meet her. Time has proven what she instinctively knows: Frederick Wentworth was the right man for her and she was foolish to let him go.His reappearance sets the stage for what is, at once a masterpiece of comedy, romance and satire. Anne's vainglorious father and sisters are deftly skewered, but in that mocking but never mean Austen style. The appearance of an estranged cousin and Captain Wentworth's apparent attachment to a neighborhood belle complicates matters wonderfully until we reach the inevitable happy conclusion.What sets this novel apparent, I think are two characteristics. Picking up the story eight years after Anne's mistake is a wonderful device. We don't meet a perfectly sensible woman (Elizabeth Bennett) or a delightful ingenue (Emma Woodhouse). Anne Elliot is a mature woman, indeed by social standards close to an old maid, and one left to regret her own poor judgment. Her situation is one any empathetic reader can identify with (who hasn't judged wrongly in Romance?) and creates a humility that is quite appealing. Unlike Elizabeth and Emma who need to learn the error of their ways, Anne already knows--she simply needs to be excused them.Secondly, unlike some Austen works, characters are far more dimensional. Anne is weak, but well-intended. Wentworth acknowledges he is bitter and resentful and acknowledges he fails to initiate a reconciliation out of pride, losing further years they might have been together. Elliot pere and Elliot the heir are quite cartoonish as is sister Elizabeth. However Anne's friend and confident and her sister Mary are more nuanced and therfore more appealing than most of Austen's minor characters.Is Persuasion worth reading? Without a doubt! Where does it fit in the Austen cannon? I think in the first rank. But everyone should decide for themselves.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This book is the 5th in the \"Horatio Hornblower\" series by C.S. Forester. It is in my opinion the best book of the series, and this is high praise, because this is one of the best adventure series in all of literature.In this novel, Captain Hornblower, Captain of HMS Lydia, a British frigate, is dispatched to the west coast of South America, on a mission to make trouble for Spain, which has allied itself with Napoleon, against whom Britain is in a desperate struggle. At first, all seems to go well, but events beyond Hornblower's control intervene, and soon he is fighting battles and using his wits. It is all wonderful adventure.Forester's writing is taut. His storyline is brisk. The novel moves from adventure to adventure in a manner that is absolutely absorbing. This book never drags. This is a story of adventure and hardship. Captain Hornblower, El Supremo, Lady Barbara are all unforgettable. The battles at sea are so real you can smell the powder.

As a snapshot of English social life at the time it was written, it is faultless. The plot, while somewhat inconsequential by today's so-called &quot;standards&quot;, is entertaining, and leaves the reader in a state of suspense up 'till the conclusion. The dialogue is also very charming, witty, and definately a product of it's time, but relevant. There are novels throughout the history of literature that stand as epoches for certain time periods, and Emma can be realistically called one of them. It wraps up the early 19th century English social life period very well, and more realistically and less sense of being dated than Pride and Prejudice or some of Jane Austen's other novels (or those of her contemporaries.)

It also makes fun of the government and what some people think the government is like. In this book, the animals overthrow Manor Farm and rename it Animal Farm. The animals want to prove that they are better than Man and can do everything he can. The pigs take charge and come up with seven commandments that they and the rest of the animals must follow. They also determine the retireing age and how rations will be divided amongst themselves. The pigs end up evil and do away with a few characters that they feel are not assetes to the farm. Overall, Animal Farm was a great book.Animal Farm makes you think about different things a lot. It makes you wonder if the world you live in is as diplomatic as you thought it was and how many things are kept secret from the public. It also makes you ask yourself what would happen if animals really were smarter than us and suddenly had a revolution. Everything would be turned upside down and the world would be crazier than it is today.George Orwell depicts the characters in such a vivid way, that you can see everyone deliberating and doing their work and whatnot. You can see all of the battles against the farmers and the pigs talking to everyone and everything else that's going on during the story.Animal Farm is a book you have to read a few times so you can make sure you didn't miss any of the many underlying themes it has. It gives you a bigger perspective of the world and makes you realize that things may not always be the way someone makes you think that they are. This book is great if you like that kind of thing.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I found this book to be a joy to read.

This is a novel for mature readers who enjoy books which don't have excessive violence, or mindless action on every page.

I am beginning to really dislike this series. I am all for steamy sex scenes, but this book is like reading a compilation of vampire\/werewolf erotica\/short stories.I admit the vampire hunter angle was what first drew me, but the murder mystery and the characters were what really kept me in the series. Now the plotline is all about the ardeur. I almost want to skip over those parts now; I'm so sick of it! I really hope she gains control of it soon or I am going to lose interest completely in the books. I read an afterword in one of Hamilton's earlier books and how she is exploring the darker sides of crime, but I think that this is falling at the wayside in favor of these horrible sex scenes. They're so frequent that it's actually boring.The contrasting characters in Richard and Jean-Claude was wonderful in the beginning, and now I'm hoping Richard is killed off. I actually had an awful thought that he was the killer near the end. That he lost it bad enough that he went rogue. His self-desctruction is so sickening and self-pitying, however no one addresses how he almost got them killed. Where is Jean-Claude's spine? I hear more about what he's wearing that about his character. I really miss the old Jean-Claude. I also liked Asher when he was at least halfway angry about what happened with Julianna. Now he's as woe-is-me as Richard, just not with such horrible consequences.There is also the annoying internal debate about her morality. GET OVER IT ALREADY! If LKH is going to forge ahead with these awful sex scenes, and if Anita is going to be such an all-powerful ball-buster, let's give the girl a spine, too. Anita's tug-of-war of conscience is basically just a repeat of, \"I don't want to be a monster, but what I do makes me one.\" And so on and so on. LKH's occasional references to God and prayer and her interpretation of the Bible is pretty uncomfortable and seems sort of misplaced. She doesn't breathe a prayer that her shot to kill the bad guy goes true or for help on how to get out of an impossible situation, but on who to have sex with or how to soothe one of her many lovers' egos.I really hope the next book has more murder plotline than this last book, and less sex, mind-numbing descriptions of clothing, and more wit.

Other major characters, Dr. Aziz and Professor Fielding, are great friends, to the point where Fielding severs relations with his separatist British friends in honor of his wrongly arrested Indian friend. But, through strange facts and circumstances, Aziz begins to hate, then detest and ultimately love him again.Perhaps the greatest love, with no hate, is Mrs. Moore. She loves Indians - not just India. Indians respond with a loving chant of her name - Esmiss Esmoor. She rises to the divine. But, alas even she must demure to the almighty British imperialistic state - this is a 1924 novel when India and Britain were in a love-hate relationship of their own.This novel is Forster's great rebound. Thought to be a severely suffering writer-blocked novelist, he could reach no more for Italy to spur him to the typewriter (\"A Room with a View\" and \"Where Angels Fear to Tread\"). Unlike \"Room\" or \"Angels\", he does not deliver an ethical question to the reader as handled by British aristocracy. The moral or ethical question here is directed to all Brits -- rich or poor, new to India or born to India -- and asks if what they do to others is devastingly harmful, let alone inappropriate.Divided in the three parts, the book sets you up [Part I: Mosque], slams the British [Part II: Caves] and sums it up [Part III: Temple]. To his credit, Forster's delivery of this book may have been as recklessly brave as Fielding's protection of Dr. Aziz - the British with whom each associates would not kindly take to each's allegiance to the \"other\" side.Much akin to America's great \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", this novel deals with the classic trial of a great citizen of the oppressed who allegedly acted wrongly to one of the young white women. Unlike \"Mockingbird\", this book concentrates more on the victim of the allegations and allows him to receive true justice - the white woman in this trial has a great deal more character and saves his day.I can only wonder how this book affected Britain. Like Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\", people were probably enlightened by this book's revelations. British people would have had to discuss the atrocities contained within the pages of this novel and social change would inevitably follow. Written strongly with great drama, this book unfortunately remains applicable to today's world and probably still would be discussed if delivered to themainstream reading masses.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This book is one of the classics and it is always worth a read for fantasy lovers.

As a matter of fact, each of the `chapter' of \"Lives of Girls and Women\" ends in itself. In other words, each of them has a beginning, middle, and an end. However, it is not the vital to decided whether this book is a novel or a collection of short stories. Either one will not change how brilliant it is.The second book published by Alice Munro, this is one of her best accomplished works as a whole. Her posterior collections have some of her best short stories ever - but as a whole they do not keep the same level. However in this one, none of the chapters is better or worse than the following one.Throughout a 40-year career, Alice Munro has established herself as one of the most important writers currently working. Her stories deal with ordinary people, whose lives would not be supposedly interesting. But, in her pages, this lives become unforgettable.In \"Lives of Girls and Women\" we follow the upbringing of a girl in rural Canada - this could be an autobiographical book, but it is not the point to discover it. We accompany Del Jordan since her childhood until her days as a young woman expecting to go to the university and chance the pattern in her family's life.\"Lives of Girls and Women\" are, after all, a book about changing times. At some point, Del's mother notices that `there is a change coming I think in the lives of girls and women'. More than thirty years after its first publishing, the book proves that those changes came to stay.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"AD&amp;D 3rd addition brings welcomed, exciting changes to arguable the best role playing game on the market. It'll certainly take some getting used to for people who have been playing earlier editions for a long time. Saving throws have been decrease in number for the better; skills have been increased for more personalization of characters. With the experience points per level being the same for all of the classes, each class is equally powerful as the party progresses through the game. This makes it more exciting to play wizards at earlier levels and druids at later levels, for example. Also new are the 0th level spells (cantrips) and increased number of spells for wizards (but slower spell progression at higher levels).My one major complaint is that the book is perhaps a little too colorful. Normally this would not be a bad thing, but I find it difficult to flip to a page of interest because the titles and sections seem to blend together, with almost everything being colored evenly. While some people (myself included) complain that the spells are listed alphabetically and not by level, this is easily worked around if you look up the spells by classification (enchantment, evocation, etc). Under each classification the spells are listed by level which makes referencing spells fairly simple.Still, Wizards of the Coast has put out a quality product which shows the three years of play-testing that the 3rd Edition went through before it hit the market. It is also less expensive that the final printing of the second edition which is also nice for return players (i.e. the first printing of the second edition was ca. $20 a book while the second printing was ca. $30 a book. I doubt they would have had as many old time players as well as new players purchasing the core rules for $40 a book). Everything together a great product which instills new enthusiasm in a game which has stretched the imaginations of many.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I don't know what to call this book. It got me into climbing (really) but it's not a mountaineering work. It sometimes reads like Monty Python, but it's not a comedic work. It sometimes reads like a soap opera but it's not that either.What is it? To paraphrase the book itself, it's an earnestly silly work about a crazy idea that turned out to be deadly serious. It doesn't really try to be anything, it just presents things as they happened, and (I loved this bit) it's up to the reader to fly the book.

Her father is a pastor, and she is obviously religious. I wouldn't be surprised if she had had the book as mandatory reading for school.I think using the name Joshua instead of Jesus helps one create a different person while reading, which was probably Moore's intent. The historical aspects of the book fascinate me entirely; the relationship portrayed between Romans and Jews during that time is both entertaining and interesting. Hearing about how people traveled and about how they lived during that time was always something I wanted to know more about, even if in a fictional novel.

This book explicates as much as it outlines. Any Sheng Yen book tends to be an absolute find. I'd have to say that this book has impressed me most thus far, out of all the Ch'an books I own...(I own a LOT).Expect to learn very nearly everything you ever wanted to know about Ch'an and the subtleties of samadhi and practice. American Ch'an\/Zen practictioners, you simply have to have this book. If you're shikantaza'd out, welcome to an intelligent Ch'an book to set you straight again and make sense of non-sectarian Ch'an. It's a worthwhile meditation, even if you intellectually \"know\" everything contained (Which would likely mean you are already ordained or well on the way or the equivalent). Sheng Yen is a great teacher, and sometimes it's not what's said, but how the teacher says it that makes the overwhelming difference. Sheng Yen has much to say on emphases and overlooked aspects in Rinzai and Soto differentiated Zen practice, illustrating how Zen is not intellectualism, not cold \"emptiness,\" not \"just sitting,\" but rather a full sweeping life-transforming experience that entails everything one does, and is not owned by any one practice, faith, school, sect or tradition. This is also perhaps something of a cure for those who are brainwashed into thinking that there is no such thing as bad\/wrong zen or that one spiritual path is automatically equivalent to another.The quality of attention and straightforwardness that Sheng Yen puts into every chapter and subject in this book is somewhat impressive. Historical and schematic overview lends great depth of understanding to whatever one already knows of any of the various forms of Buddhist and Ch'an practices.What if we all bowed to each other when we passed on the street, instead of playing games relating to our appearance and presumed cultural cache or gender roles? What if we all looked on each other with the warm glow of enlightenment, rather than cool, smug competitiveness as the auto-default style of interaction nowadays? If you have ever asked yourself this question in a sincere state of mind, then Sheng Yen's Ch'an is also yours. This is a skillfully-written technical manual of sorts on how the engine of Ch'an practice really works, written by a trained and aged monk who has entirely devoted his life to perfecting, teaching and articulating Ch'an practice.This is a book I think I will probably come back to again and again.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This book was everything it's title suggests.

One can go back to the archives of any newspaper or magazine and read old book reviews and see if the comments have stood the test of time. In the case of Manchester's first 2 volumes on Churchill the critics weren't very nice. A 28 year old and new NYTimes critic Michiko Kakutani called volume one a bore that covered no new ground. She preferred Martin Gilbert's 4,000 pages leading up to 1939 to Manchester's 2,000 pages to mid 1940. Other critics think Manchester was superficial and found some of his superlatives to describe Churchill or generalizations about English society to be grating. Many of the most important comments remain so today; that Manchester did not seriously research and refute criticism of Churchill that was available to him.Gilbert has written over 80 books on a variety of topics. As Churchill's official biographer many have concluded that he tossed is objectivity out and became too much of a fan. Where Manchester's second volume stands up well is it's dramatic depiction of Churchill standing up to issues of German rearmament and English Appeasement policies of MacDonald, Baldwin and Chamberlain. He does an excellent job recounting history and believes he has uncovered countless facts that strung together nearly reflect a conspiracy by the English government to hide the build up. He offers comments and insights at every turn which are welcome as his point is to educate and influence. As in volume one he quotes from a very broad set of diaries and sources that enrich the experience and he introduces many of the essential players of that era in ways that go beyond the biography.There are serious problems however. Manchester really likes Churchill and as a result his failures are recounted but not condemned and often excused. He was in the same camp as the appeasers in seeing Communism as the main threat and as such he held Mussolini and Franco in high regard. As Exchequer he lead England back on to the gold standard in the 1920's which contributed to economic collapse in the 30's. And his actions in Norway are excused as being watered down by Chamberlain's other cabinet ministers rather than the disaster that it was. His disrespect of just about everyone is explained away rather than discussed as a possible reason for his estrangement.Manchester frequently says Chamberlain was against rearmament because it would hurt the economy but Manchester never explains well the condition of England at that time. Given Manchester's earnestness in placing us within English culture at the time sighting the major books, plays and music of the time it's a startling gap particularly given the frequency of comments on Chamberlain's motives.Overall we do get a very strong case for how appeasement went wrong. It's riveting and provocative. We also get a view on Churchill's home life where he struggled to stay out of debt and seemed to have weak relations with his family. Manchester is clear in his view that Churchill was a lone voice that spoke out frequently and courageously and he sees him as a brilliant multi tasker writing books and articles at a furious pace while keeping up with developments in Europe through his own intelligence network. Unfortunately it feels one sided which may unfairly undermine Manchester's credibility. Had he incorporated and discussed some of criticism of Churchill in more detail I think he would still have been successful in depicting Churchill as he saw him but giving the reader a more rounded view, warts and all.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"A Mango Shaped Space is an interesting coming-of-age book about a young lady who 'sees' sounds as variations of color (something that actually does happen for a small percentage of people).

When I read this book, I instantly became friends with Anne Elliot, the family outcast, because she was an outcast. Then she became even more my friend when she became the beloved and desired friend and love of Captain Wentworth. I loved seeing Anne go through the difficulties of dealing with her past actions, and instead of wanting to go back and change the past, she wanted to go forward and decide the future. Austen masterfully portrays all of her characters, and I would love to go to Lyme and see where Anne met her cousin, and to Bath to see where she and Captain Wentworth decided their future together.

After a harrowing journey, he joins up with a band of outlaws, led by the brutal Captain Glanton. The group is on a mission to Mexico, to prosper from a growing enterprise: the scalping of Native Americans. It is a bloody life, and the Kid faces triumphs and tragedies on his way to a tragic adulthood.There are several comparrisons I could make between \"Blood Meridian\" and examples from classic literature, yet nothing I can think of seems to do it justice. This is simply a classic work of art. Grandiose, epic in scope, it is the bloody, heartbreaking saga of a too-often forgotten period in American history. The fact that this book is based on actual events will chill your blood. It is unflinchingly honest in its portrayal of characters--there are no saints here.One of the most interesting aspects of \"Blood Meridian\" is that it introduces a literary character who, decades from now, will be regarded as one of the great fictional inventions of literature: Judge Holden. A towering figure, he easily ranks up there with Conrad's Kurtz or any of Shakespeare's tragic rulers. Suffice it to say, \"Blood Meridian\" will be taught in college literature courses in the years to come (I'm sure it is already, somewhere), and will become the bane and guilty pleasure of literary afficianados. McCarthy's prose, as always, is elegant and delightfully dense; no easy reading, but well-worth the time you invest in it. You'll come away a richer, more self-aware individual. Think I'm over-doing it a bit? Then buy the book--buy any of his books--and take the challenge. McCarthy isn't writing for a generation, or a specific audience; he's writing for the ages. This is literature, folks--literature at its absolute finest.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This is without a doubt the best book I've read ever, and really, it is outstanding.

Anita is a delightful character, though she seems both too cynical and too experienced for a mere 24-year-old (I think Anita thinks and acts more like a woman in her 30s, quite frankly), but her comments, both to herself and to the other characters had me chuckling out loud every few pages, which is a rare experience for me, and made up for some of the sloppy writing and editing. Jean-Claude is a great addition to the pantheon of fictional vampires and a worthy romantic partner and Hamilton deserves credit for being able to create distinct personalities for even many of the minor characters.

The story begins like this: Samuel Spade is a hard-boiled private eye established in San Francisco. He and his partner, Miles Archer, are approached by a beautiful woman from New York who asks them to tail a man named Floyd Thursby, who supposedly ran off with her younger sister. One of them is murdered that night and things take off from there. If you decide to traverse deeper into the novel, you'll soon become completely absorbed in one of Dashiell Hammett's glowing treasures.You can probably compare this book to a \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" movie --- by the last quarter, loyalties shift and advantages are earned by gaining the right type of leverage. As the title suggests, there's a Maltese falcon in the middle of it all. It's an intricate framework but nothing that you'll get lost over.Gutman, Cairo, \"Miss Wonderly,\" and Wilmer are great characters, each with a very distinct personality. They are defined by their unique mannerism and dialogue during conversation. Samuel Spade, the main character, has appeared in some of Hammett's other stories, and is considered the archetype of tough detective characters. Based on the decisions he makes at the end of the book, you'll see what kind of person he is and what kind of code of ethics he lives by.Hammett's writing style was sometimes compared to Hemingway's and it's easy to see why in this novel. The Maltese Falcon is written economically. There's no extravagant embellishment or flowery description. Only the essentials. Here's a paragraph that demonstrates Hammett's deft touch nicely:\"A telephone-bell rang in darkness. When it had rung three times bed-springs creaked, fingers fumbled on wood, something small and hard thudded on a carpeted floor, the springs creaked again, and a man's voice said ...\"A clear picture is created from those sentences without all the unnecessary pronouns and articles. Hammett's writing is quick and neat. (This novel, in my opinion, only reveals the beginning of Hammett's way with prose. I must admit, after reading \"Nightmare Town\" I was surprised to see Hammett's full range and ability. He manages to describe things more atmospherically while maintaining elements of his terse style.)In this novel, Dashiell Hammett purposely withholds the reader from certain knowledge, such as the motives for Spade's actions. Although you are always with him, you are never really told what Spade's plans or intentions are, leaving you to fit the pieces of that puzzle on your own. When Spade tells the infamous fat man, Gutman, that he possesses valuable information about the falcon, the fat man can not tell for sure whether he's telling the truth or bluffing. And neither can you! Rather than being frustrating, this is a preferred method of story-telling since it produces mystery and suspense. It helps that Hammett's conversations are described to minute detail since figuring out intentions involve examining the mien of conversations, looking at small gestures and facial expressions.Overall, this is a great book and worth a few hours of your valuable time. If you're looking for one of the best in the classic detective genre, then look no further than The Maltese Falcon.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Good book, easy reading.

I read Goodkind because I like Goodkind, and any complaints I have aren't because I also read other works. As to Temple of the Winds, this is perhaps the weakest book in the series so far. I've always thought the biggest problem with these books is that it looks as if he set out to write a stand alone novel, only to have it become so popular that he was asked to do sequels by the publisher. The proof of this in my mind is that nowhere in Wizard's First Rule is there and mention that it's Book 1 of the Sword of Truth series. But, conversely, Wizard's First Rule and Stone of Tears sat very well together. Blood of the Fold was thinner, but here in Temple of the Winds, the first real knots start to come undone. Significant characters pop into this book out of the main characters pasts, having never even been alluded to before, and as is Goodkinds most irritating wont, these turn into red herring plot lines that endup being closed again before the end of the book. Meanwhile, little or no progress seems to be happening with the furthurance of the supposed current main plot point having to do with Lord Richard Rahl's battle for supremecy over the Dream Walker Jagang. Without the hype and without the comparisons to others, this was the least satisfying of the series.

It was a book that I was to read again and again until the paperback novel finally fell to pieces.This is an unusual read, with an even more unusual storyline. Its hero is a young boy called Waldo who is born with Down's syndrome or Mongolism as it was known then. His parents, a white middle aged, middle class family guiltily consign him to n expensive \"special\" home in which he spends his first few years of life. Accidentally given a continual overdose of highly potent vitamins, combined with his missing chromosome, Waldo emerges from his chrysalis as a genius but a secret genius who does not trust the world that has confined him to the Shady Glade Institute.With the constant chatter of TV in the background, Waldo learns about the world through the highly politicised news of the day. Waldo is a child growing up in the 1960s and is a living witness to a world filled with violence, war and extreme change in which he is going to play a very BIG part.Cunning, sly and incredibly intelligent, Waldo fools all the hospital staff and his family into thinking he is an above average Mongol but nothing too spectacular that will get him overly noticed. Befriending a burnt out CIA agent who has been sent to Shady Glade to recuperate after a breakdown, Waldo eventually reveals himself to the man and acquires his first friend and convert to his cause. His next friend however is not so well chosen, a young girl, who almost betrays his secret and only his sheer intelligence gets him through the tests and questions that follow and it is this experience that makes Waldo realise he has to leave Shady Glade or eventually he will expose. What better place to go than his guilt ridden parents house in the suburbs?And so Waldo worms his way into their affection and finally their house. And it is here he starts his empire building. \"Borrowing\" some money from his parent's bank account he starts to make money on the stock market and eventually moves into politics helped by the now released and slightly less burnt out CIA agent who comes to revere the boy's brains and cunning and together they set out to change the very fabric of post Watergate politics.Waldo's first ally in his bid for political domination is the family Black Maid who he pays to run errands from. She is the first person to have a semblance of understanding about Waldo's abilities and grows to respect him though their friendship is based on his need and her greed. When his parents finally find out about Waldo's corporations and his multi million dollars they are drawn into his finally tuned web, becoming his staunchest supporters.The story climaxes with Waldo's mother's death and a promise he makes to her. He will get America out of Vietnam and it is to this end that book makes its steady journey.Never boring, often tongue in cheek but done so subtly you are barely aware of it, this is a wonderful book that punches you constantly in the chest with its dry wit, cutting dark humour and its portrayal of a USA in transition.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"&quot;The Lost Bird&quot; is the fifth in Margaret Coel's beautifully written series set on the Wind River Arapaho Reservation in Wyoming.

The story involves the murder of the mission's 72-year-old assistant priest, who has recently returned to the reservation after a 35-year absence; the search for her biological parents by a movie actress who thinks she was born to Arapahos; an unexpected visit from Father John's architect niece, who is troubled about her parentage; and some dark secrets from the past. I think fans of Tony Hillerman are likely to enjoy this series. There's less mysticism here, but these mysteries are steeped in Arapaho culture. Ms. Coel is a historian of the American West, and her novels are well researched. Most important, she knows how to write a good, suspenseful whodunit.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Zoe Koplowitz is a no nonsense, straight shooter, beacon of hope and inspiration to anyone facing life challenges.

This book contains such problems in spades. The idea that all human disease can be washed away through psychotherapy is laughable, and some of the other science is equally quaint. I'd even go so far as to say that the authors should have known better, even in the '50s, or that they misunderstood (perhaps delibrately) some of the basic laws of science. Fortunately, the science is really just the medium through which the story can be told. The real theme of this book is the nature of humanity. I'm afraid the authors have a very unflattering opinion of human nature!The story: Little \"Crazy Joe\" Carter is a telepath - an honest-to-goodness mind-reader. Unfortunately, since there is no scientific theory that can support the notion of telepathy, and in the highly politicized scientific commnuity of this future world, his abilities are dismissed the evidence ignored. Only a few free-thinkers accept the evidence, and they dare not discuss their results. This suits Joe fine, and he is eventually brought to a (fictional) U.S. university where he works on a military-sponsored artificial intellegence project. Through Joe's subtle manipulation of the team's feelings and prejudices, he allows pychologists, computer scientists, engineers, etc. to work in harmony to create \"Bossy.\" They then feed all human knowledge into her and discover that through Bossy-directed therapy, people are \"reborn\" - physically fit, stripped of prejudice, and with their inate telepathic ability activated.Much of this territory has been re-covered since this novel has been published (just watch a few episodes of Star Trek!), and it's often covered better. But I still enjoyed this prototypical study of the human brain proceeding (aided by Bossy) through its next step of evolution. Clifton and Riley are unforgiving in their depiction of modern man - we are all prejudiced, only about different things. We can be stampeded by effective propeganda to do obviously foolish things. We would \"rather be right\" in our own convictions than be shown a better way, even to the detriment of our health, prosperity, etc.On the surface, the closest analogy I can think of is the Simpson's episode \"Lisa the Skeptic\", wherein a skeleton that looks like an angel is found and the townspeople go on an anti-science riot. A thoughtful reader will perhaps be able to look past the preaching and appreciate the message the authors are trying to convey: No one has a monopoly on the Truth, so don't be afraid to question your assumptions.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"As an ACOC there were many bad days in my life.

Some people, like her father, consider blacks as human and equal. Others still view them as separate and unequal.Since Scout's mother died, her father allows her to figure out life in her own way--traipsing around in overalls, instead of dresses, with her brother Jem. Aunt Alexandra wants to teach Scout to be a lady, but to do so goes against Scout's dad's philosophy of life.In some ways, Harper Lee expresses some rather forward thinking.

After reading the first 2 chapters, I became so inspired that I started drawing myself. I'd never drawn anything artistic before. But I was able to follow the lessons and was quite surprised at the results I got. My child is 6 years old and I could see the changes in his drawing once he got the 5 basic elements of shape concept.The book embeds many important concepts about how to teach children drawing between the lessons. For example, it explains the difference between symbolic drawing and realistic drawing in children and the importance of not interfering the development of each. These are very helpful for those who are new to drawing.I find the lesson itself pretty easy to follow, but the drawing theories and techniques between the lessons might take much more time to explain to a 6 years old. So I broke one lesson and the concepts into smaller lessons that last about half hour.The only thing I don't like about the book is: you need to make photocopies of some pages in the book for the lessons. It is not easy to make photocopies from a book--the pictures were distorted a bit and the size wasn't quite right. For lesson 2, I couldn't get a good copy of the lion --- the face is completely dark even though I used a commercial copier. I think this is the publisher's fault.In conclusion: I strongly recommend this book to those who want to draw or teach children to draw and think you are not good enough to start.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"For vacation, I picked up quite a few books that had beach and or southern themes. Out of the many I've read, Nevada Barr's Deep South is the best one so far.Anna Pigeon is a National Park Service ranger who transfers to the Natchez Trace as part of a promotion. Ranger Pigeon isn't even officially on duty when events start happening at a furious pace. The worst is that a local teenaged girl is found murdered after her prom. Anna is faced with a variety of obstacles that include nasty alligators, racism, sexism, disgruntled colleagues, a bunch of teenagers reluctant to tell the truth and southerners who dislike Yankees. Pigeon must also become acclimated to her new home, The Natchez Trace National Park, a lush, beautiful but forbidding place that doesn't give up her secrets very readily.One aspect of Barr's books that is most enjoyable is the education she gives us on the National Park Service and the parks that play key roles in her novels. The Natchez Trace is actually 444 miles, and is rich in both Native American and Civil War history. I have never visited this area, but Deep South has certainly peaked my interest.Barr's characters are also so believable. All of them are flawed in some way or another. None of them is a true hero. But most of them look into their souls and try to do the right thing. The plot was very good and Deep South ended with a bang.I've only read one other Barr novel, but I need to start seeking out her other books.

But, then a jeer to the same publisher for not bothering to take the time to let a human proof the manuscript. (Hint: computer spell checkers don't find words that are spelled correctly but used incorrectly like &quot;ad&quot; for &quot;and&quot; and &quot;as&quot; for &quot;has&quot;). The number of typos in the author's text (not Abigail's unique spelling)is exasperating in places. Nevertheless, the book is a delightful read about Abigail's life, her love for her husband, her (sometimes overbearing) love for her children and most of all her love for her nascent country. Withey points out the many contradictions in Abigail's life: a woman who advocated improved education for women but was by no means the feminist many have tried to make her out to be; a woman who opposed slavery and saw that it would one day divide the country and yet who grew up in a family that owned two slaves. Having grown up in Braintree and Quincy myself the thing which spoke loudest to me was the deep-rooted Puritanism in Abigail's blood, the self-reliance, the willingness to completely subjugate her own happiness even allowing herself to be separated from her husband for the better part of ten years and the need to try to keep her children on the straight and narrow. Yet, Abigail is much softer here than the shrew portrayed in Nagel's book on John Quincy. You can help but admire her and feel sorry for the many trials she went through.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Much has been written about the Nuremberg Trials.

His paintings were created using alternating layers of color and transparent varnish over a monochromatic underpainting, sometimes totaling as many as 60 layers. This technique was superb for period reproductions using the four color printing process.As one critic stated, `Everyone recognizes the magical world woven by Parrish, usually with the color lapiz lazuli in its purest form. His signature use of this color was so powerful that a certain cobalt blue became known as `Parrish Blue'. His idealized images with figures of feminine pulchritude adorned in classical gowns with backgrounds of electric violets, radiant reds and rich glowing earth tone pigments, created an idyllic world indeed. Other images had scenes embellished with billowing clouds in a fairy tale ambience of maidens and knights lying under porticoes and these were equally harmonic, idealistic, and beloved. Books illustrated by Parrish no longer belonged to their authors, but rather they became `Parrish' books, just as a generic color became `Parrish Blue.' As a result of this ability to create such a sublime splendor, Maxfield Parrish became unquestionably the most successful and best-known American illustrator of the early part of the twentieth century.'Of the several book published on the life and works of Maxfield Parrish this volume is considered a catalogue raisonn&eacute; as constructed and commented upon by Judy and Lawrence Cutler who were also privileged to include many of the personal information about he artist as a courtesy from his family. While this book served as a catalogue accompanying a traveling exhibition, it sands alone as a well-documented tribute to a unique American artist.

The initial puzzling discoveries are made by an ordinary young Englishman in the first chapter. He is holidaying in France. His amateur investigations suggest that a trade in pit props across the English Channel is a cover for a smuggling racket. His investigations are later linked with a Scotland Yard murder investigation. The Scotland Yard man is Inspector Willis of the Criminal Investigation Department. The author describes him as \"plodding and tenacious to an extraordinary degree\". In his next book, Freeman Wills Crofts developed this character, re-named him Joseph French, and retained him in all his subsequent books.Things which the author does very well are evident in this 1923 book. There are several long surveillance sequences. Seymour Merriman, the ordinary young Englishman, and his friend Claud Hilliard, take turns in secreting themselves in a barrel on a wharf in order to observe the unloading of a ship's cargo. Their amateur detecting, and Scotland Yard's better resourced investigating, provide absorbing reading throughout this relatively long yarn. There is also a love interest, and this is not something the author does well. A certain Miss Coburn, much like the heroine of a Victorian melodrama, reiterates from time to time \"it can never be\" whenever the ordinary young Englishman suggests marriage to her.Over all is the warm nostalgic glow that emanates from many of the 1920s examples of the \"Golden Age of Detective Fiction\", a glow that is brightly reflected in this splendid reprint from The House of Stratus.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"This was an excellent book.

For those of us who are used to thinking of manga as a media for the young, where the sexuality is mostly represented by over-abundant prettiness and thinly disguised innuendo, Urotsukidoji is quite a shock. To call it lurid and violent is an understatement. It serves the purpose of creating a deep sense of moral horror, but leaves unanswered the question of whether or not Toshio Maeda's setting is gratuitous or necessary to support his apocalyptic vision of damnation and tortured redemption.The story, simply enough, is about the prophesied coming of the Choujin, or Overfiend. It is foretold that this being will unite the three worlds of the humans (ninjinkai), demons (makai), and the half-human animal spirits (juujinkai). This is support to usher in a period of great peace and prosperity. But, as the story develops, it becomes graphically clear that one demon's peace may very will not have the same meaning to a human. What actually seems to develop is a apocalyptic vision of a world torn between sexual perversion and physical destruction - in equal amounts.The vision is spectacular at the same time it is deeply repulsive. The characters, who are all portrayed as both victims and perpetrators, fail at anything resembling mutual affection. Lust, not love, is the key to the entry in this not-very-brave new world. Well drawn and written, the impact is intentionally confusing and overwhelming. As humans, our vision is too limited to integrate the horror we see with and grander vision.I'm not sure if the series started out as hentai (Japanese graphic pornography) and then developed an artistic life of its own, or whether Maeda simply used the hentai overlay to tell what he felt is an important fable. That is a decision each reader will have to make if they choose to follow this challenging tale.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"It's just over half an inch thick, and just slightly bigger than pocket sized.

Interesting tricks, properties and characteristics of numbers make this worthwhile for the masses.My last Algebra class was in college in 1974. I don't remember most of the concepts. I don't remember the face or name of any of the students in that class or even the Professor; however, I do remember one of the tricks that professor used to spark our interests. While that trick is not in this book it serves to tell you the type things that are in this book.That trick is this. The square of any two digit number ending in 5 will always end in 25. The first digit can be found by multiplying the number by itself and then adding that number to it. For example--25 squared is found by 2 x 2 + 2 = 6 followed by an ending of 25 = 625. Another example is 85 squared = 8 x 8 + 8 ending in 25 = 7225 while 95 squared = 9 x 9 + 9 = 90 with 25 behind it = 9025.While that particular mathematical trick is not in the book, the point is that math presented in the manner of this book and that of my 1974 algebra teacher make learning fun and it will stick with the learner for years to come.I recommend this book to students, parents, teachers and those who enjoy or wish they could enjoy mathematics.

Fox provides a clear, and very interesting look at aspects and highlights of his life with regards to his career, family, and especially his dealings with Parkinson's disease. He has great courage and is very candid. He also is a good writer and is very intelligent, but is not perfect. He reveals how he has also overcome alcoholism and his time in the Hollywood \"funhouse,\" as he calls it to discover what really matters in life. His discovery has been aided by his struggle with Parkinson's Disease at a very young age and I believe that is why he considers himself a \"lucky man.\" He says the ten years since Parkinson's have been the best of his life. His foundation strives to bring awareness to sufferers of Parkinson's in order to curtail discrimination and possibly foster a cure through research, especially stem-cell research, in ten years. I recommend this book to everyone, especially people suffering Parkinson's, and other devastating brain diseases. It will give them hope and encouragement. The book was so interesting I could not put it down and I read it all in about three days.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"In Peter Robinson's latest Inspector Banks novel, \"Close to Home,\" Banks interrupts an idyllic vacation on a Greek island to look into the death of a childhood friend. Graham Marshall, a \"mate\" of Alan Banks when they were both teenagers, disappeared in 1965. A worker digging the foundation for a new shopping center unexpectedly uncovers a skeleton that turns out to be Graham's remains. Who killed Graham and why? Coincidentally, Banks, along with his former lover, Detective Inspector Annie Cabbot, also begins looking into the disappearance of Luke Armitage, a troubled teenager from a well-known family.Banks has changed greatly over the years. He is mellower and more reflective than he has ever been before. Although he still likes to smoke and drink, Banks is beginning to feel the effects a bit more, and he is actually trying to cut down. In addition, now that his ex-wife and children have moved on with their lives, Banks has had a great deal of time to take stock of where his own life is heading.\"Close to Home\" has many of Peter Robinson's trademark touches. The author delves deeply into the psyche of his characters. Robinson takes the time to humanize the police officers, the criminals, and the suspects in his novels. The reader becomes involved with their predicaments and deeply invested in the outcome of the story. In addition, Robinson introduces another interesting female character, Detective Inspector Michelle Hart, a woman with a tragic past to whom Banks is attracted.In \"Close to Home,\" unfortunately, Robinson missteps a bit. First of all, he has gone to the well once too often when he chose the \"bones uncovered after many years\" story line. This plot was used successfully in Robinson's own \"In a Dry Season\", and again in at least three other mysteries that I have read recently. I am surprised at this lack of originality in an author as creative as Robinson. In addition, at almost four hundred pages, the book meanders a bit and takes too long to reach its melodramatic denouement.In addition, Robinson is a little too heavy handed when he hammers home his recurring theme, which is that the past is never really behind us. Until we come to terms with the events of long ago, and until we exorcise the demons that plague us, we can never hope to face the future and find happiness in life. Robinson has expressed this viewpoint in his previous novels many times, but with more finesse and subtlety than he does here. I have come to expect a great deal from an author as accomplished as Peter Robinson. Although \"Close to Home\" is a serviceable mystery, it is not an excellent one.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I believe I have read all of Rosamunde Pilcher's books but somehow missed this one until just last week.

I was slightly disappointed that the text turned out to be somewhat superficial, repeating much of what the author has written in more extensive detail in his earlier books. It may be a useful book to buy if you don't already own his other manuals but it's overpriced and redundant if you do. It's really a sort of extended FAQs or troubleshooting manual, presented in question-and-answer format, and the length of the \"solutions\" to the questions ranges from a couple of paragraphs to a couple of pages. Few of the solutions are discussed in any great depth, and one has the impression of being in a conference hall where the clock is ticking and the lecturer has been instructed to answer as many questions as possible before the coffee break. It contains a great number of interesting questions, but the answers tend to be unbalanced in terms of detail. A question about placing three fingers in the mouth as a way of opening the throat gets one and a half pages' worth of answer, but one on breathiness in the high register of female singers (surely the more important of the two) receives only 9 lines in reply. In view of the wealth of information at Miller's disposal, the problem probably lies at the hands of the commissioning editor responsible for the book's structure, rather than with the author.","sentiment_score":0.6},{"review":"I was a professor at the Univ. of Puerto Rico during the 1980s, and return occasionally for scientific work. I also teach a Tropical Biology course every other year that includes spring break in Puerto Rico. I've read about eight guides to Puerto Rico and nearby islands, and I think this is the best in terms of accurately reviewing history, culture, and some of the biology and geology. The photographs are extraordinary, and really capture the island in all its facets. This Guide also gives the best information about each town's history and points of interest. It probably devotes the least space to casinos and cruise ship information, but I see that as a strength. I want my students to develop some understanding of the history and culture of Puerto Rico, even though it's a biology class, and I have found the first couple chapters of the Insight Guide do a better job than any of the drier academic sources out there.

It has a great selection of christmas songs which seem so far (as others mentioned) to be traditional arrangements. Also as another mentioned, this is NOT the book described by William R Braun, i.e. it is NOT spiral bound, it does NOT contain the song \"Brazilian Sleighbells\" if you were looking for that, and some of the songs are in 3-4 flats or sharpsFor me, the main advantage of spiral bound books is that they stay open when placed on a music stand and don't keep closing on their own like some other bindings. This is is a necessary feature for an instrumentalist, however it is my experience that after much use the pages and cover often tear out of spiral bound books, and therefore are not as durable as some other types of bindings.The Definitive Christmas Collection 3rd edition is a big book loaded with great songs (i.m.o.) and even though it may not lay perfectly flat like spiral bound it stays open nicely to the page to which it was turned.I would definitely recommend this book, I just wish Amazon would get on the ball and remove the misleading description by William R Braun.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Unfortunately, most reviews for this book miss the fact that it a quite comprehensive ART HISTORY book on specific subject, much more than a book for children.

An accomplished young artist from an upper class Victorian family, she left the comforts of England and went into Algeria, a country inhabitated by Arabs who were mostly Muslim. It was a slow but steady start, because of language problems, government interference (because of suspicions about missionaries motives), and just the differences in the different ways of thinking and lifestyles of the Algerian people.Lilias spent several decades of her life doing the \"basics\" in securing the beginnings of a life long ministry among a people hungry for deep spiritual lessons, but finding ways to do this required much patience, thought and forgiveness. And on top of all this, she is dealing with a new language, both spoken and written.The majority of this book is taken from Lilias's copius journals, letters and writings where she kept records of what she was involved in day by day.I learned a lot about what the foreign missionary effort entails, and especially when you're the first to go into an area with some brand new ideas where life is so different. But she won them over slowly with her love. As time went on, she had much help from other women and men who worked with her in this cause.The last couple of decades her health was not good, but she just kept on plugging away, even writing from her bed the last two years.She wrote some beautiful booklets that have profound lessons of faith and obedience in them. \"Parables of the Cross\" and \"Parables of the Christ Life\" are just two of them.She gleaned such meaningful lessons from nature, things that the ordinary person would hardly think of. She could see great lessons from a grain of wheat, a peach, a bee, etc. She looked deeply into the whys and wherefores of the lessons that nature has to teach us.Lilias really had a heart for these people and she felt that God gave her that heart and she was to do what she could as well as she could for as long as she could. She was true to that effort.One thing I wished this book had was a map of the area that showed all the little towns and outposts that were mentioned in the book, and were developed over many years and many travels.This book is a good read, even though you are dealing with some new words and another way of thinking. You will learn a lot and wish you had known this woman who was totally devoted to God.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I love reading dystopian stories. Although they seem like paranormal stories in a sense, they also have this feeling of \"My God, this could actually happen.\" That's how I felt reading The Giver. I was surprised with how monotone the Community was, and as I read along and found out the people chose this life, it felt real to me in a sense. If this life was a possibility, I wouldn't be surprised that people would chose it: It's a life with no hurt or pain, no anger or sadness, nor any negative feelings\/emotions of any kind. The sacrifice is that people also feel no happiness, love, or any positive emotions. That was the choice. To live in Sameness.Because this was a book club read, my head is chocked full of questions with half-answers, and debates about the book. We had a lot to talk about with this one. It's hard to give any examples without giving spoilers, so I apologize that I can't really explain. I will say that it is definitely a book that will get you thinking, if you allow yourself. If you really think about the world they live in, how they function on a day-to-day basis, and then how Jonas shown the \"way things once had been\" and has to take it all in stride, it will have you feeling some strong things.As for the characters themselves, I thought that Jonas and the Giver were deep, thorough characters, while the rest were all the same. Considering the fact that the Community's number one goal was Sameness, I have to say that the characters were written perfectly. Aside from the two main characters, there were maybe 1 or 2 other characters that I felt anything towards, and that was because of the way Jonas felt about them. Lois Lowry definitely did a good job writing her characters so that you felt what Jonas felt.Whether you have to read this for school in Grade 7 or choose to read it years later, The Giver is a great dystopian that will open your eyes to the way things might be if we finally break and are too afraid to be different.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Charmian Carr recounts her experience appearing as Liesl in the 1965 movie,The Sound of Music.

Though she was 21 at the time of shooting, she spent little time off-camera with the film's stars, Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, but has lots of very flattering things to say about the director and producer, Robert Wise and Saul Chaplin.Even though I'd heard most of the stories before in interviews, this was still a very pleasant read about a movie that is a sentimental favorite of mine, told with all the youthful cheerfulness of the character of Liesl.

The first involves sending positive energy to your internal organs and other structures so that they can function better. The second is the &quot;microcosmic orbit,&quot; a very ancient practice which moves energy in a circular motion up the spine, over the head, down the front of the body, and back up the spine. At the end of this exercise the chi is then focused in the Tan Tien center, right below the navel.The microcosmic orbit differs from the Hatha Yoga practice of raising the kundalini energy up the spine in that in the Taoist practice you always bring the energy back down, thus grounding it. Much of the purported danger in these sorts of energy exercises comes from leaving the energy &quot;raised,&quot; which sometimes happens in Hatha Yoga, or so I am told.Thus I don't agree with the warnings that these exercises are dangerous when not practiced with a master. Although I do have a Tai chi\/Chi Kung teacher, I started these exercises years ago when I was working alone. The most notable change that I have experienced doing the microcosmic orbit is that I have many more lucid dreams than ever before, plus a sense of having a clearer energy field.It is important to note that Chia does not make any reference to Taoist yoga as a religious practice. You may do these exercises as a Taoist, a Christian, a Buddhist, a Wiccan, whatever. They are simply exercises to learn about and work with your own life-force energy.If you are working with a teacher, this book is a good adjunct as it has diagrams of the energy pathways and certain internal organs which you should know about. If you don't yet have a teacher, the book will introduce the subject in a straightforward, simple way that you can easily work with.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Greg \"Pappy\" Boginton was a colorful person, a rebel, a maverick and a helluva good pilot. He did not take any nonsense from anyone. Back in WW2, it was more acceptable to be a hard drinker, but even by those standards, Pappy had problems, which he admits to in his Bio of 1958.Of course the media make a huge deal out of who shot down how many Japanese planes, and Pappy felt this pressure, as well as those of leading a squadron of Marine pilots. Back in the early days of WW2, the US was just beginning to reign supreme over the Japanese.After 26 victories, he was shot down and spent time as a guest in a Japanese POW camp for 20 months where torture was routine and brutal.Success did not come so easily to Pappy after the war, but after finally winning his struggle with alcohol, things improved and he enjoyed a resurgence of popularity and fame when the 1971 TV series came out with Robert Conrad playing Pappy. Anyone familiar with the show knows that it is a very Hollywoodized version of what happened.This is a good bio, the writing style is understated, which was common back then. People did not write graphic tell-alls like they do now.

Now that I'm nearly 40 years older than I was then, there are little quirks of writing that are more noticeable (the heroine seems to bite her lip rather frequently, for instance), but all in all, the tale has held up well.The story concerns the trials and tribulations of 23-year-old Linda Martin, born and raised in France but more recently schooled in an orphanage in England, who returns to France as the governess of the young Comte Phillipe de Valmy. Phillipe, unfortunately, is all that stands between his uncle Leon, who is his guardian, and the Valmy estate, which Leon loves with an obsessive love made stronger by the fact that he is a paraplegic (I did mention melodrama, didn't I?). Circumstance piles on circumstance until Linda realizes that she must save Phillipe, even if this dooms her own budding romance with Leon's son, Raoul.Part of what makes Linda a real person to me is that she's very well-educated--not so much by her orphanage, but by her very literary papa. Because Linda's thoughts are full of literary allusions, Mary Stewart can play with all the stories of misunderstood maidens, poor governesses, and handsome wrecks of men. Cinderella walks hand in hand with Jane Eyre, and Lady Macbeth is also in evidence. By bringing these allusions to the fore, Sewart cleverly escapes the charge of repetition and makes what one might call the history of melodrama part of the plot.Mary Stewart is also a genuinely good writer. Thus, tense scenes have real tension, and romantic scenes have real romance. While she always stays within the conventions of the Gothic novel form, she does it with grace, elegance, and even, at times, beauty.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Miss the series? Collins serves up a generous helping of backstory to the Max Guevara we've all come to know and love. The story expands on the small details that are already known: we are pulled along through the harrowing X5 breakout from Manticore, up through Max's first contacts with the \"normal\" world and right on up to the catastrophic Pulse that brings the United States down to Third World status. Much of the story deals with Max honing her craft as a professional thief on the mean streets of post-Pulse Los Angeles. Circumstance and a possible lead on an X5 \"sibling\" send her north into Seattle, and we are treated to the tale of how she met Original Cindy, how she moved in with Kendra, how she started with Jam Pony, where she first heard of Eyes Only, and even the spiritual importance of the Space Needle to Max's \"meditations.\" Logan Cale features prominently as well, in some wonderful foreshadowing scenes. Original characters include fellow X5 \"Seth\" and Russian gangster-cum-art dealer Kafelnikov, and for fans who've missed the first season's villain Donald Lydecker, there's plenty of him in this novel, too.The novel, being more or less unrestricted in its scope and direction, allows the reader to dive more fully into the gritty near-future of post-Pulse America -the language is coarser and more realistic than the cleaned-up television dialogue. Instead of having to hear characters remind viewers that \"the world went and got a lot nastier,\" we are able to actually immerse ourselves in it; much more thought-provoking, particularly if you're prone to playing the \"what would YOU do?\" speculation game. In all ways an excellent lead-in to the events of the series pilot.

When identical twin sisters Amanda and Marian Laton are forced to move from their Massachusetts home after the death of their father in the late 1800's, they are unprepared for the adventure at their Aunt Kathleen's Texas ranch. Chad Kincaid, ranch employee and son of a neighboring rancher escorts the women on their final leg of the journey, convinced that Amanda is the desirable one, while Marian is the bookish shrew.But Chad's first impression of the two women is categorically wrong, as an unlikely twist finds Marian dressing dowdily so that men won't be caught in the beauteous Amanda's net if they dare to notice Marian first. Add in Chad's confusion over the fact that he thought that he made love to Amanda (though it was really Marian), and he just might be honor bound to marry the self-centered Amanda, unless he can persuade Spencer Evans to beat him to the altar.Though the plot theme that a young Victorian era woman must marry to claim her inheritance is hardly a new one, Ms. Lindsay has put an interesting slant to this idea with the immense greed of Amanda versus the solitude seeking of Marian. Spicy romance between Chad and Marian keeps that pace at a fast clip, as Chad discovers the beauty and caring soul Marian keeps hidden behind thick ugly spectacles.

All the wonderful things that I said about the first book continue to apply. We get to see a \"what-if\" America where magic actually works, and our history is revealed in alternate ways (like George Washington having been executed at the start of the revolution). This series has been a lifeline for me in the fantasy genra.The good of Red Prophet:1) Alvin is finally coming into his powers a little. No more accidental board splitting - now he runs to the melody of greensong and goes to places where no white man has ever been.2) In this book, we run into historical celebrities like Napoleon, the Marquis De La Feyette, more from William Blake (Taleswapper), Andrew Jackson, and Tippy-Canoe Harrison. Its neat seeing the writer's interpretation of these historical figures, and they were well done, if not completely accurately (as the author states about Harrison, for example).3) The characters are never, every one dimensional. The good guys aren't all good, and the bad guys - even the worst guys - have limits to their vileness. In fact, there's an ever-present feeling of the power of redemption throughout this book which I found appealing. I kept hoping that certain people would rise to the occasion - no spoilers though!The bad of Red Prophet:1)I would have liked to see even more of Taleswapper. He's the most interesting side-character in the entire series. I think Card avoids heavy usage of him because it requires incredibly diligent writing, and its just plain difficult. And I totally appreciate his work here.2) I was disappointed with Alvin's dad and brothers when they did \"a certain act\".

This is the geographic region where this prized author spent all of his time (generally outdoors) writing and observing, and was a very studious &quot;freak of nature&quot;, so to speak. A surprisingly interesting read, &quot;Of Mice And Men&quot; focuses on two subjects named George and Lennie. George dreams of getting steady work on an animal farm, while his aimless, slow-witted friend (Lennie) has an ongoing desire to pet (and mangle) mice and other assorted creatures. These two take up residence with various other persons along their evasive journey as well. But, there's one pressing problem: Could George tame Lennie long enough to help make this dream a reality?

Just the same, as in any chick-lit novels, everything was well and as it should be towards the end.It took me almost three weeks to finish this book, and I questioned myself why. It just didn't have that pull on me that I sometimes found myself browsing the net rather than reading the book. It's always a struggle for me to read 18th century writings; I always have to go back and reread for a more thorough understanding of what's being said. This is my second book by Jane Austen, and I'm probably getting tired of all the ceremonious ways of her period. Still, I could not fault the writing, being from a long ago era and true to it; it also elicited `hate and like' feelings towards the characters which is a sure indication of good literature...But still, I labored through it...so three stars to be fair to Ms. Austen and to myself.","sentiment_score":0.6},{"review":"Fellas, get your game together, the &quot;love game&quot; that is! This message definitely comes across loud and clear from former European pro basketball star Gerry Wright. In 2-sizzling hot volumes titled, Straight Talk: Playing For Keeps and Papa's Got a Brand New Bag, Wright gives raw tutorials on winning a woman's love and affection.The book flows easily with an urban humor that brings to mind the comic styles of Richard Pryor and Chris Rock. However, the sharp humor and comic riffs are only used as accents to lighten his tell-it-like-it-is, straight-no-chaser delivery which goes right to the heart of serious man\/woman communication, relationship and sexual issues. His mixture of tenderness, humor and hard-edged advice is masterful. He wittingly coaches men, and up-lifts women. This a must read for anyone, man or woman interested in improving their lovelife and relationship.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"If you have never made gingerbread before, this is the book for you.

Wheeler's interest in medieval history comes through in his vivid descriptions of the towns, taverns, clothing, and weaponry. His martial arts background comes into play in the well-designed fight sequences.Most importantly, Wheeler's characters are complex and interesting. There is a definite line between good and evil, Forbidden magic and Earth magic, yet the characters are in no way one-dimensional. Though LANDMOOR fits in with &quot;clean fiction&quot; suitable for younger readers, it is not &quot;fluffy bunnies and lollipops.&quot; Not by a long shot. I thought Wheeler's creative approach to &quot;cussing&quot; added a nice touch of humor to the book.The only mildly annoying aspect of the book is that the ending is a bit of a cliff-hanger. Clearly, LANDMOOR is meant to be part of a series. Fortunately, the world Wheeler has created is easily intriguing enough to support one with little difficulty.In short, if you enjoy high fantasy, you'll love this book.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Charles Chadwick's sprawling (682 page) novel is an amazing feat. It takes a mighty story to glue a reader's eyes to a tome of this size and that is why this is such an odd victory: there really is no 'story' per se, just the private musings of a man who describes himself as a gray being - \"I've noted before, I think, that the impression I seem to give is one of neutrality. I feel pretty neutral about that.\" Language of this sort becomes not that of ennui but of profound introspection on a perceived common life.Tom Ripple is a loner, avoiding contact with other humans whenever possible, a man who goes to extremes to just be anonymous. His main driver appears to being convinced that he - and the rest of the world's inhabitants - are simply 'all right'. He avoids interaction with neighbors (even a disarmingly acute need to confront a pederast) and with troubled people in general. His aloof stance creates a safety cocoon for him: \"A friendship loomed, making me feel decidedly unfriendly. I accepted of course.\" Though events occur (in abundance) around him, Ripple skirts them or at best denies any interest in intervention.Yet despite the continuing pages of interior dialogue by a man removed from the world while walking the turf of that world, there is something about Tom Ripple that creates an indelible character, one of those literary creatures that become part of our vocabulary. Think 'Rabbit Run', 'Catcher in the Rye' and at the same time remember this is the first novel by a 72-year-old author! Quite an achievement. Let's hope there are more books from this Charles Chadwick.

Yes, there are no &quot;on screen&quot; appearances by monsters and there is no crazed slasher in the book but it is extremely scary.

While most find it comfortable to judge such behaviors as aberrant, Burnham and Phelan argue that it is important to recognize the potential benefits of our devilish drives (often in a dramatically different context) and to devise ways to defeat their hold on us.This book summarizes in swift, illuminating strokes the extensive scientific research that supports the argument of the authors.

I am married to a native of Korea. I found the writings of this author to be amazingly narrow minded. While he did broaden his horizon of thought as he got older, it seemed evident to me that he over generalized both whites and all other races. Whites are not all rich bigots and those of other races are not all oppressed impoverished folk. I grew up dirt poor and was taught that all people, including those of other races, are equal. I have always realized that those coming from poorer socio economic circumstances need more help and consideration than others, regardless of race. I certainly didn't appreciate nor like the tone of the author telling me that simply because I'm white, I'm ignorant to the plight of others. I fear too many whites have jumped on the politically correct band wagon that says white man is the cause of all others woes and thus have swallowed this single minded garbage.

S. K.'s journals and excerpts don't always make for the most fluent reading, and so Lowrie's comments and clarifications do well to bind the whole life together and shine light on much of the more ambiguous meaning. The chronology of his life in the book is a bit confusing at times and, because he lets Kierkegaard do a lot of the talking, Lowrie forfeits the chance to present as compelling a narrative as some biographies do, but S.K.'s life is so dramatic and interesting in and of itself that the reading is nevertheless arresting.The \"Short Life\" is a little dated at this point, but is written by one of the Kierkegaard scholars of the day, and I think it should provide any student or casual reader with a fine introduction to the man's thought and the events that shaped and colored that thought so powerfully.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"if you like to make dolls this is a book for you.

I had to do a book report on it in 5th grade and ended up reading numerous times for various projects throughout grade school.The reader follows the main character--aptly named &quot;Christian&quot;--on his journey to the Celestial City.Along the way, Christian passes through the many trials of life, symbolized by intruiging characters and places along the way. An early temptation is the &quot;City of Destruction&quot;, which Christian narrowly escapes with his life. The various characters are perhaps the most fascinating portion of the book--Pliable, Giant Despair, Talkative, Faithful, Evangelist, and numerous others provide the reader with a continual picture of the various forces at work to distract (or perhaps, encourage)Christian on his ultimate mission.Of course, the theology (for those of the Christian faith) of Pilgrim's Progress is a constant source of debate, the book is nonetheless a classic of great English writing.It's not a quick read--that's for sure--however, I certainly would recommend that one read it in its original form.

The description of our heroine was introduced as sweet, caring and innocent. BUT... &lt;--- That's a big but with caps. I find her more selfish and greedy, naive and stupid (sorry..my opinion) than the sweet girl who wants to help the less fortunate. First, she offers to marry him and then 'CLAIMS' half of the fortune he has (though he had offered quite a generous amount to begin with...greedy much...it doesn't matter what she plans to do with it.. I would be shame-faced to even ask for so much as a penny, let alone 'claime'..since the money isn't even hers to begin with). Then she goes and make conditions for him and later when he comes up with one condition of his own, she won't allow it. Moreover, she keeps hinting at wanting to reform him but then ultimately falls under the enemy as naive as any green girl out of the schoolroom. Really, you would have thought she'll know better then to consort with the enemy (let's not mention her ways with scandal or close call scandal).

Another reason is that, like all classics, it's about the human experience. A 50+ year old book tackles themes still relevant today.A young French Algerian man, Meursault, kills an Arab for little reason and is tried for murder. The book is an examination of a dispassionate killer that doesn't seem to care for anything, even whether he lives or dies. Is Meursault is a typical sociopath or just an indifferent slob getting by? I was taken by how his lack of passion was read by every character in the book differently. He seems cold to the funeral director when his mother dies. But his new girlfriend is attracted by the same lack of passion. His boss sees him as a good employee though odd. Ultimately the court sees him as a mad killer. They all see what they want to see.The lack of any human feeling was ultimately the demise of Meursault. He could have done all of the same things, but if he had only shown some emotion, he would have survived. I find this very true in life. Our emotions are read for the good and bad. We are expected to be dispassionate when we're professional and passionate when we're in love. The deviation from those expectations many times leads us to trouble even when our actual actions are appropriate. Meursault's actions are questionable, but it is easy to see that with a little charm and personality, he could have easily talked himself out of all of his troubles.Of the 20th century classics, it is certainly one of the shortest, and it has plenty to say. I liked it enough that I will attempt another Camus in the future.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Included in this collection is the best single 5 pages, perhaps, in century 20 American fiction, a short-short story called \"Graven Image.\" It is worth the price of the book, and anyone coming to O'Hara is advised to begin his encounter here.O'Hara was much maligned and misunderstood in his lifetime, and remains so. Irish but Protestant, chain-smoking, rancourous but wise, it is now becoming clear what a giant he was. Everybody mocked O'Hara, mistaking his oft-tawdry subject matter for himself, a process at times he seemed to mischieviously collaborate in. Everywhere, that is, except on paper. They are all long dead now so it no longer matters, only the paper survives. He was perhaps equal to any century 20 American short fiction writer, a very high compliment when Faulkner, Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Cheever, Capote, Updike, Carolyn Gordon et al are in the running.Well, fellow Americans, stand up for this determined upsetter of convention. Read him and weep. While a lot of his coevals ran off to Paris, Africa or wherever, O'Hara stayed at home and minutely recorded a massive and awful transformation of his beloved nation -- chiefly chronicling the breakdown in the institution of marriage and the spread of Gilded Age pretense into ordinary folks everywhere, with spreading affluence and free time galore. It is painful stuff for each and every one of us too, delivered without comment or overt moralizing. Son of a small town doctor, he wielded a cold pen the way his pa used a scalpel. No wonder everybody hated him -- but the result is a body of work meticulously recording the massive social changes in the USA with the precision of glacier-cut striations on granite.\"There it is now gentleman, you can take your hats off now,\" John Peale Bishop said upon the death of Scott Fitzgerald.

Years ago, I read most all of Hunter Thompson's books, but I missed this one. I always intended to get around to it but it always got put on the back-burner.Well, having recently been a fan of the FX TV show Sons of Anarchy, and after finding this book in the garage after a cleaning frenzy, I decided it was time.On the good side -I found myself cracking up every few pages. This book is not nearly as laugh-out-loud as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, or Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail, but it's still got its moments. There are also horrifying moments to be sure, but he manages to slip in an observation or a description that is vintage Thompson.I found the book very interesting, and he not only talks about the Hell's Angels from the time he was with them (1965-66), but he educates us about the history of that group and other biker gangs. They essentially started when WWll vets returned home, and Hunter goes on to explain the origin of the 1% ers - the outlaw motorcyclists that are at odds with the AMA (the American Motorcycle Association.)I have read some criticism that Hunter mythologizes this group as heroes, and I certainly didn't get that impression from this book. Thompson does humanize many of the bikers with nicknames straight out of Bad Guy central casting, but I never saw this as his being reverential to them. In fact, especially in the later chapters, he goes on to explain why he feels they are the \"losers\" in society, banded together with an allegiance only to each other and with the knowledge that they live in the here and now because their future is so unknowable and bleak.Thompson also does a good job of showing how the media is more to blame for the group's barbarian image, than their actual exploits. Mind you, Thompson certain details examples of violence and savagery that would scare anyone and earn them their reputation - but the media's exaggeration of some of the more well-known events only served to make them famous. They became every decent citizens scary boogeymen, and they achieved a certain cachet or prestige just because of that.So is the book dated? In some ways, it is. This is certainly not 1965, and MC gangs like the Hell's Angels don't have the press or attention they used to get. Yet, I still found the book so interesting, and Thompson has a way of describing the type of marginalized personality that gravitates to this type of lifestyle in a way that's relevant today.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"All good things have to come to an end, and Jennifer Blake's Louisiana Gentlemen series concludes with the fascinating story of brother Wade.This series has featured the Benedict family of Turn-Coupe, a strongly connected family whose history dates back to the earliest days of the southern state of Louisiana.

It is simple, easy to understand and use as a reference book. Sometimes, I write the positive thought or affirmation many times over and over, only to discover that the ailment is gone. I definitely recommend anyone in alternative medicine or healing practice use this book as one for reference.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is far and away the best book I have ever read, and considering I read about a book a week, that is definitely saying something.I'm not going to give you another review of the storyline because there are probably a hundred others on here already so to do it again would seem quite pointless. What I want is to give people a couple of reasons why this book is so great. One of them is that the book is so well balanced and what I call an \"everything book\" because it has a great balance of everything in it: adventure, romance, mystery, humor, etc. There is really no one category you could put this book under which I think makes it even better.The other thing that makes this book so great (along with the great storyline) is the writing style of Dumas. First of all, he is never overly descriptive which is something that a lot of authors tend to do. He uses just the right amount of description on the scene and then lets the characters take over from there. Also, he has this wonderful way of always making the reader want to continue on to the next chapter. You just can't put the book down! Everything just seems to flow in such an effortless manner. Many nights I was up at two in the morning because I just couldn't put the book down.Do yourself a favor and read this book (unabridged penguin classics version, of course) and I can promise you that you will not be disappointed.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"What spell-bound me to Odd Thomas, the first novel in this series was the originality, freshness of voice, prose; strong character and humor at the right places; and deathly on my seat waiting for the next thing to happen.Unfortunately, none of this was true for Forever Odd.It took me awhile to get to this review because I just couldn't figure out WHY I didn't like this book.Ok, as one of the reviewers mentioned, unhelpful votes abound!The reasons why this book didn't grip as Odd Thomas did is:1) The story was sloppier than the first novel. Many slight bumps went into the unsmooth storytelling. At chapter nine and ten, it threw me off that Odd was chasing the van where the kidnappers were and then, suddenly, in chapter ten, he was back at his friend Ozzie's place? When I read it the first few times, it seemed like a chapter or two had been cut. Too sudden.From chapters Eleven to Twelve, he was still at Ozzie's then he went to the Blue Moon Cafe? I didn't have any sense that Odd walked out of the house.2) here's some potential ***Spoilers*********************The villain, or anti-Hero\/paradox Odd was an annoying character. Didn't like her a bit. Her demise wasn't exactly what I was hoping for, and I didn't know how she died until I had to re-read it for a third time.She didn't seem at all fitting in Odd's world, and her appearance left a bad taste for me. I don't like having the \"evil v. good\" theme played out here. Somehow, I didn't get that sense in the first book that was how Odd was supposed to be....She, also, despite being derranged, didn't seem at all the \"villain\". The \"typical villain character\" was missing in her. Too comical to some extent and she had the expectant ending.3) Danny. I liked him and didn't like him. Also, his appearance in the book was all too short. Odd talks about him a lot, but he appears for brief moments. Not enough for me to enjoy him. And, there wasn't much of an 'ending' with him not being in the last few pages of the book.4) A certain crispness in interaction between Odd and the villain was missing. Didn't seem genuine enough.5) oh yes, Elvis-ghost is getting old. Let's have a new ghost companion, already.Okay. To the things I liked:1) Odd grew as a character, and stepped out of his world. He became a \"hero\" when he needed to be.2) His trickery of the \"villain\" with the poltergeist thing was original and cool.Overall, not as satisfactory as the first one. Still, a good read.","sentiment_score":0.6},{"review":"One thing about the adventures of Capt. Jack Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin: they're rich and strange, and none in the entire 20-book series is richer or stranger than this #13. After a false start, Aubrey and Maturin voyage to the island of Pulo Prabang in the East Indies, with intrigues, sea fights, cyclones, espionage, madness, and strange creatures abounding. My favorite episode occurs when Maturin takes a break from lethal political maneuvers against French agents to climb the 10,000 steps to the Buddhist shrine in the island's interior, and meets the orangutans who inhabit the area. Weird? You have no idea. . . But it's terrific fun, especially when the round-the-world voyage continues in the three books that follow, THE NUTMEG OF CONSOLATION, THE TRUELOVE (aka CLARISSA OAKES), and THE WINE-DARK SEA.

I love the intrepid teenage heroine, Hallie Palmer, and the author's straightforward, funny, clever writing style and turns-of-phrase. Laura Pedersen's books bring to mind the charm, eccentricity, and small-town appeal of BECAUSE OF WINN-DIXIE for an older teenage audience.Hallie's story continues in the second book, HEART'S DESIRE, during the summer after her first year away at college. Hallie returns to the wildly eccentric, wonderful Stockton household, pre-occupied with (someday) losing her virginity, finding true love, and figuring out if the two are inextricably linked. She's also faced with new crises to solve, both in her old family and in her new one, and another 60-second mystery, in addition to figuring out how to fund her second year of art school (legally).The Sex issue comes up again; actually, it is pervasive throughout HEART'S DESIRE, as 17-year-old Hallie grapples with the complexities of love and sex. Laura Pedersen again handles this subject exceptionally well, with humor and sensitivity.I enjoyed the interviews with the author at the end of each book, and look forward to continuation of the Hallie Palmer series.Enjoy!Sherri Caldwell, co-author, The Rebel Housewife Rules: To Heck With Domestic Bliss!","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Dover publishing has succeeded in printing a very affordable edition of the Bach-Gesellschaft editions of these major Bach works.

If they do, they risk rape and mutilation at the hands of the products of late 20th century political correctness. Harper Lee's brilliant novel gives us a view of what is what like at the other end of the pendulum swing, and lets us see what life was like back then - through the eyes of a very young, precocious tomboy named Scout. All of the ills that plague our society are there... rape, prejudice, fear of the unknown, and just plain meanness. Ms. Lee confronts these ills, but leads you slowly through a gentile, scenic picture of Maycomb County, Alabama during the Great Depression.I was first introduced to this story by watching the movie on TV in the late 1960's and was fascinated with the story from the children's point of view. Later, when reading the novel in the 10th grade I realized that Ms. Lee had given us a compelling masterpiece dealing with crime, ignorance, prejudice, innocence, and community that stands out as one of the most enduring classics of the last century. Children were still allowed to be children back then. We follow the adventures of Scout, her older brother Jem, and their friend Dill until their adventures bring us into the rape trial of Tom Robinson, a black man being defended by her father. It is against the backdrop of the a 1930s rape trial that we are introduced to Atticus Finch, one of the best written father figures to ever spring from the mind of an author. His client is a black man accused of raping a white woman. It is through his relationship with his children that we experience the need to transcend social injustice with courage and compassion. The dialect of the characters, the colorful locals, and the rhythm and pace of the story is perfect. It is seasoned with humor, suspense, and some of the most wonderfully entertaining narrative prose I have ever read. I just re-read this book for the 15th time, and still highly recommend. Whether you're 15 or 95, To Kill A Mockingbird is still a sensational reading experience. After reading To Kill a Mockingbird you'll wish we had more people like Atticus Finch to make us feel safe and protected.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"The reason I first bought this book is because I was told that I would have to read it in the grade I am about to enter.

If the point of non-fiction is to provide one with a new and unique way of seeing the everyday, then Michael Pollan has succeeded beyond all measure.

While well written, the book is thin on security matters; security is only first dealt with in chapter six. That coverage is interrupted by five chapters on building wireless networks. Discussion of security doesn't resume until chapter twelve.Despite its title, the book is more about setting up, configuring, and managing wireless networks, with occasional digressions into security issues.

This book proves that some originals are too good to ever be repeated. While it's overly tempting to read this solely as a &quot;reply&quot; to Heinlein's Starship Troopers (which in part it certainly is), it manages to skewer almost every cliche and convention of vintage SF. Even Asimov's Foundation Series, represented by the planet covering imperial capital gets a gentle tweak, as a question possibly never considered by Asimov himself is examined, to wit: in a planet sized city, who takes out the garbage?

While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \"Pride and Prejudice\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \"Pride and Prejudice\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Having Sherif Yenen's book at hand is like having access to a first rate tourist guide whenever desired.

Morrison returns with the handsome and unforgettable Wellington Jones and his soul mate Jada \"Diamond\" Tanner for another round this time in Never Again Once More. Unfortunately for readers, Wellington is married to another as is Jada, but when it comes to matters of the heart these two make us wonder; does anything else matter?Some readers were disappointed with the break-up of Wellington and Jada towards the end of Soul Mates Dissipates, Mary B.Morrison's sister novel to Never Again Once More. I believe it is because of the readers' idea of what a soul mate is or should be. I enjoyed the book because it showed us how couples who are soul mates are not always put together at the right time.Never Again Once More takes us twenty years into Wellington and Jada's future. Emotionally time stood still for Wellington and Jada, but they learned to go with the motions learning to love others while the passion they held simmering slowly began to heat up and burn those around them. The time might not have been the most opportune for Wellington and Jada, but love takes no prisoners.The characters in Never Again Once More all had hidden desires that they masked by settling for less, until their hearts could hold out no longer. It's funny how the mouth verbalizes never, but the heart screams once more. I thoroughly enjoyed this book; having the chance to meet with old characters from Soul Mates Dissipates and seeing their growth was a welcomed treat.At the beginning of Never Again Once More the time warping was a little confusing and I almost lost the story,but Mary B Morrison made up for it throughout the book, with her clear messages and well developed old and new characters that will tug at your heart....","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Frankenstein; or The Modern Prometheus, first published in 1818, is well-deserved classic of science fiction and horror. Mary Shelley's work, much like the similarly influential Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson (see my review of that here on Amazon for more on that tale), has almost been forgotten in its original form, as so many adaptations - most quite different from the original - have been produced in the nearly two centuries since it first appeared.The story begins with an introductory framing narrative by Robert Walton, an arctic explorer who catches a glimpse of a giant person traveling through the ice shortly before rescuing a stranded traveler who turns out to be Victor Frankenstein.Frankentein, a young Swiss student of chemistry and natural philosophy, relates his tale to Walton, who then records it in letters to his sister in England. Frankenstein describes how he created artificial life, only to be repulsed by the hideousness of the new being. Frankenstein abandons the creature, which then disappears.However, some time later, the creature begins taking revenge for his abandonment and misery upon Frankenstein's loved ones. Eventually tracking his creation down, the being tells Frankenstein his own tale of how he has attempted to befriend humans, only to be hated and driven away each time. The creature extracts a promise from Frankenstein to create a mate for him, after which the pair will disappear.Frankenstein begins to work on another creature, but eventually decides that he cannot create another monster and destroys his work. This prompts the creature to continue his campaign of revenge upon Frankenstein, eventually leading to the chase into the arctic. At this point, Walton resumes the narration and describes the final climax of the relationship between Frankenstein and his creation.The central theme of the story is the creation of life and the responsibility of the creator to his creation, as framed by the now-classic science fiction device of the artificial creation of life. Frankenstein, though the main character, could hardly be described as a hero in this narrative with his abandonment of the creature and self-centered actions, and the creature manages to illicit both sympathy from his lonely misery and horror with the lengths to which he will go to enact his revenge. Shelley does a fine job of taking the reader between these contradictions.I listened to the audio version read by Ralph Cosham, a favorite narrator of mine, and can certainly recommend Cosham's reading of the tale. Cosham's readings of the classics are always well done.Shelley's language will sound archaic to modern readers. However, if you can manage to get past that or you actually enjoy that style, Frankenstein is well worth reading. It has earned its place in popular culture and as a foundational tale in both the science fiction and horror genres. Do yourself a favor, and read the original Frankenstein. You'll find a lot more than the grunting, shambling monster of the movies. Shelley's creation is as alive, powerful, and intelligent as Frankenstein's.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Never tire of reading the &#34; oldies&#34; but &#34; goodies&#34; The tried and true literature of the past always brings pleasure to the reader.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Bought this while touring this region of France and found it invaluable both there and as a reference work later.

Fans of those will certainly like it, and it is a great place for neophytes to start.Lewis uses his signature documentary-style to bring alive yet another slice of Americana - Protestant fundamentalism, which was enjoying one of its periodic revivals as he was writing shortly before the Great Depression. Lewis did a vast amount of field research, and it shows; he brings a fictional world alive as only he can by focusing on just the right details and drawing them vividly. So well-executed was his technique, and so great his popularity, that many early readers said Lewis' fictional America was at least as real to them as most of the actual country outside their area. This is still true to a great degree; his portrayal is so painstakingly detailed that the descriptive sections often seem more like a history lesson than a novel. Such a statement is apt to scare many but is true in the best possible way; the book is never even remotely close to boring. It indeed pulls us in almost immediately, and our interest stays at an apex throughout most of the book; this was 1927's bestselling novel, and it is easy to see why. Lewis is the rare author who can write long expositions but make them fit the story, seeming to arise naturally rather than overwhelming it. Thus, though supremely entertaining, Elmer is an invaluable historical document for anyone interested in fundamentalism or the era.However, most will still be drawn to what first made the book a sensation - its stunningly realistic and unrelentingly satiric fundamentalism expose. Lewis was the greatest American satirist since Mark Twain, and this may well be his most biting portrayal, which truly says much. He shows the hypocrisy, lies, and deceit at fundamentalism's heart, condemning it as a mass of self-indulgence. So hollow does he show it to be that it is incredible anyone ever followed it, and he certainly gives more than enough reasons for the curious to stay distant. He does so to a large extent by using traditional satirical methods to reduce religion to ridicule in the best tradition of Voltaire, Twain, and others. Like them, he makes us laugh almost in self-defense; the book indeed has many laughs, though the material could just as easily anger or sadden if presented differently, which is great satire's mark. However, he also criticizes religion on intellectual, philosophical, ethical, and historical grounds in ways that run somewhat deeper; this is again influenced by classic satirists but also takes into account philosophers' and scientists' non-literary work. Added to all this is his own absolute realism, which creates a portrait of his target so lifelike that it is a walking self-parody - so ridiculous that further attacks would be not only superfluous but near-cruel.The novel predictably caused a firestorm of controversy; it was denounced in pulpits across the country and by traveling evangelists - doubtless because many recognized its truth and some suspected (or knew) they were direct inspiration - as well as numerous self-righteous ordinary people. Denounced as Satanic, immoral, and maliciously false, Lewis was threatened with jail and even death. All this of course only proved his point - and greatly increased sales. He was after all armed with a mass of facts, and anyone who thought the story hyperbolic had only to compare Jesus' message with reactions. This aspect is significantly less striking in today's far more secular era, though fundamentalism's continued existence ensures that the book can still strike a nerve; it remains unpopular with evangelicals and a favorite of religious opponents. However, it will remain relevant even if fundamentalism - nay, Christianity, or even religion altogether - is finally obliterated as a warning against human folly, gullibility, ignorance, and pure stupidity. Even aside from the religious angle, it is valuable as an unsparing document of hypocrisy and hedonism; human nature shows no sign of lessening in these regards, and the elemental critique of these unenviable and often fatal qualities transcends its immediate subject and will probably always be needed.It is especially worthwhile in this regard because, unlike many satirists, Lewis takes care to not be overly didactic; the story may be an excuse for satire, but one would never know from reading. He makes sure to remain entertaining, which gains a larger audience and proves his points far more effectively. This is not to say he always succeeds; occasionally, as in Chapter XXVIII especially, he seems to forget he is writing a novel and lapses into the very sort of preaching he announces - though of course from the other side. Some will justify or at least extenuate this on the grounds that Christianity has had a near-unbroken monopoly on preaching in the Western world for a millennium and that the non-religious can surely be allowed a rant here and there. However, this is supposed to be a novel, and lack of dramatization is a conventional literary fault, however much one agrees with what is said. Such moments, though, are remarkably rare, which make the reading quick and engrossing.Characterization is also a large part of what makes the book so readable and memorable. This was always one of Lewis' strong suits for the same reason that his settings seem so lifelike but is particularly notable here in that the characters are so interesting even though there is hardly a conventionally likable one. A few may arouse pity, but most bring contempt and scorn. The chief example is of course the title character, who may be Lewis' greatest creation - or would be if he were not so similar to several actual people. One of literature's most thoroughly loathsome personages, Gantry is despicable in almost every conceivable way: ignorant yet vain, hapless yet lucky, hypocritical yet self-righteous, repressive yet hedonistic - in short, the extreme example of what realists find so distasteful about fundamentalist preachers. Disgusting as he is, we cannot help being fascinated, if only to find what accomplishment he will stumble on next or whose life he will now ruin without conscience for his own gain. The novel focuses mostly on him, and the narration is often filtered through his perspective, giving tremendous insight into the mind of an American con man. It is thus sort of a reverse bildungsroman; Gantry makes a stunning rise from rural obscurity to national fame without really learning anything or changing fundamentally. That he does so without being exposed - nay, that he does so at all with nothing but good looks, a loud voice, and bold confidence - is a further testament to human naivet&eacute;, ignorance, and stupidity.Many other characters are also strong, especially traveling female evangelist Sharon Falconer, who almost steals the proverbial show. She may be Lewis' most complex character and is surely his most fascinating; her depiction is significantly more nuanced than Gantry's, and we are far from sure if we can dismiss her as a charlatan like him, somewhat extenuate her as insane, or begrudgingly exalt her as an eccentric genius. Lewis himself perhaps did not know, but her inclusion is notable for showing that his fundamentalist dramatization is much less one-sided than is often claimed. Other characters mostly range from bad to worse to sickeningly evil, showing various aspects of humanity's rather large dark side. No one is championed, but a few ambivalent portraits add variety and show that Lewis held out a little hope for humanity if narrow-mindedness and mental slavery can ever be overcome.Subject matter aside, Lewis' style is not for everyone; he has indeed been taken to task since his death so fully and often that his status has dropped significantly. In the 1920s he was at American literature's forefront, and he retained living legend status until his 1951 death though his popularity had long sagged. Now he is read seemingly ever less often, and his reputation as a major writer seems in danger of disappearing, though his four classics still have relative popularity and some critics and writers continue to champion his artistry. This is due almost entirely to realism dropping out of vogue. Those who champion more recent genres will have little patience for his episodic plots, arbitrary endings, linear narratives, traditional narration, and near absence of tropes. His writing in a way seems dated and not just because it focuses so specifically on a distinct era. It is easy for even his biggest admirers to see his work as period pieces, but this sells him rather short. Lewis is a master satirist, an insightful social critic, a keen observer of manners, and a historical writer in the best sense; his realism is almost unparalleled, and his characterization is superb. Anyone who values such things can only admire him, and Elmer is an exemplary work. Whatever our view of its subject or style, it is a consummate work of its kind and great enough to transcend any ostensible limitations. It is a true American classic and, though thankfully less sociopolitically relevant than when new, is destined to remain a much-needed dash of cold water as long as people continue to fall for outwardly appealing but inwardly empty shysters like Gantry and all he represents.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"South of the border, west of the sun is my first Murakami's novel I have read.

The oldest of the children are around 12-years-old, and the youngest around 6-years-old.It amazed me how so many of the boys didn't even realize what was giong on. I realize they are children and it probably seemed like an adventure, but it seems like they would have been aware that they had an accident. They seemed so &quot;unaware&quot; of what happened. At first, the boys saw their getaway from the adults as an adventure, but as the story progresses they start to delve into the &quot;darkness in their heart&quot;.I don't even know where to begin with this books. There are so many themes that could be adressed.

At that time, his perception of the what can only be called the spiritual evolution of life on our planet coinciding with material evolution was simply too comprehensive, and did not fit in with the narrow-minded views of \"Creationism\" as perceived by religion.None-the-less, as a young graduate student in Chemistry and a new Catholic convert at the time of Vatican Council II, I read this book with extreme excitement because it did so much to make sense of what I perceived then and still believe to be the way in which the Divine has infused creation with the reality Teilhard called \"complexity-consciousness\". Teilhard believed this Divine presence is guiding our universe towards a culmination of awareness that he designated \"the Omega Point\", which others have recognized as what theology calls \"Christ Consciousness\".What caused me to revisit this book, and to purchase a new copy since my own from those early days seems to be lost in the clutter of my home, was the awareness brought into sharp focus by recent events: The \"Thought Envelope\" or Noosphere surrounding the globe that Teilhard posited has indeed come to fruition with the advent of the Internet, satellite communications and cellular telephone technology. It is now possible to instantaneously communicate with people anywhere on earth, and the potential of this for good AND ill is incredible. I believe with all my heart that what Teilhard defined as a new \"critical point\" has arrived, and it is essential that if human evolution is to continue in a positive direction, we accept the challenges he has placed before us in his insightful writing.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Paul Auster's Leviathan is a powerful and innovative story which draws the reader in and doesn't let go until the last page is drawn to a close.

The writing style is florid and archaic by modern standards, it takes a bit of patience to get used to, but the Baroness wrote a classic. Using the horrors of the French Revolution as a background, Sir Percy Blakeney is a worthy successor to such dashing heroes as Robin Hood, using his wits, courage and disguises to foil the plots of the evil French Revolutionaries and save the lives of the condemned nobility. Do not expect a balanced view of the actions of the French Revolution, this is a story of adventure, with a dashing hero, and a beautiful heroine.Lord and Lady Blakeney move in the inner circles of English society, friends of His Majesty, the Prince of Wales. But by night, Lord Percy, who seems no more than a fashionable fribble, becomes the dashing and resourceful Scarlet Pimpernel, who with his faithful friends, rescues condemned French nobility from the very jaws of death.Marguerite, Lady Blakeney, a former French actress who was once naive enough to be tricked into helping condemn a French aristocratic family, is blackmailed into helping the villian, Chauvelin, unmask the Scarlet Pimpernel, unaware that he is none other than her lazy, indifferent husband. She and Percy have become man and wife in name only since he discovered her part in condemning the aristocrats. He loves her, but he cannot forgive her for lying to him about her part in such a brutal and pitiless act. All that goes by the wayside when Sir Percy is forced to act to save both his wife, whom he truly loves despite his behavior, and her brother, not to mention his own life, from Chauvelin's trap.This is old-fashioned high adventure, and it does seem silly at times, but the relationship between Marguerite and Percy is touching and romantic. A great read for a lazy afternoon that takes you back to a simpler, easier time.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I have read The Count of Monte Cristo a few times. The Unabridged Oxford Edition is the best. The explanatory notes are a great bonus as they deepen the experience of reading this Masterpiece. The introduction gives us very interesting supplementary information that allows for a greater appreciation of the story as well as for Alexander Dumas himself. This is a book everyone should read at least once in their lifetime, and I highly recommend reading the actual book, not Kindle. This is a book that you will develop a relationship to and it becomes your friend. There's something very nostalgic and comforting about holding a real book in your hands. I may be very old fashioned, but sometimes books don't feel right when electronics are involved. I love the cover of this edition as well (revised edition 2008) . I feel that it captures the essence of Edmund Dantes: A young, beautiful man with sadness and revenge in his eyes. The painting (Leon Cogniet's self portrait) evokes an ability to penetrate the Soul of Dantes, the greatest protagonist of all time. It may sound a bit silly, but reading this book makes me pause. And when I pause, I find myself studying this image while contemplating life. Life as I experience it through this incredibly complex adventure called The Count of Monte Cristo. The story is epic!! As the back page states: 'A novel of enormous tension and excitement'. I buy this particular copy in bulk and gift it to anyone I meet who is even just slightly interested in reading it. Most people, myself included, are absorbed within minutes of reading this book and we all finish it.

I read it again in my thirties, and now again in my forties. I have experienced new adventures each journey.A treatise on Christian theology it is not. The author is quite clear on that matter in the preface. Although not about theology per se, it is prosaic theology for the soul; for anyone who has struggled; for those who know suffering, or have seen trouble and pain. Kazantzakis offers great words of nourishment for such readers. He takes the compelling story of the Christian tradition and weaves its relevance into every human's story.The narrator asks at one point: Can the word give nourishment? The rhetorical question is answered as mandate for the author as well as guide for the reader. &quot;Yes it can --- when it is the good word!&quot; Kazantzakis poses perplexing problems and questions which can only be addressed by good words. This novel abounds in goodness against the backdrop of the complexities of each person's own story. It is a worthwhile reading journey.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Simply put, &quot;Combat Mime&quot; is the best book on it's subject I have seen. While there are a number of books covering swordplay, Martinez (an experienced Fight Director) focuses entirely on unarmed stage combat and how to perform it safely and convincingly. Safety is stressed throughout, and everything is well illustrated with simple but clear line drawings.The book covers a wide range of topics including punches, kicks, falls, slaps, hair pulling, and such extras as stage blood and sound effects for a breaking bone. The many ingenious ways Martinez presents for achieving the &quot;knap,&quot; the all-important sound of impact that sells a fake hit, are invaluable. Without that sound, any stage fight looks phony, and Martinez illustrates several simple but very effective methods to avoid that pitfall.Martinez stresses that stage combat is nothing like a real fight, but actually a partnership between the actors involved in which the supposed &quot;victim&quot; is always in control. This sound, safety-concious philosophy is reflected in the title, and in every illusion presented. Despite this &quot;peaceful&quot; underpinning, the methods Martinez describes can produce stage fights that are quite convincingly violent, as I discovered when I put them to the test in my own work as a Fight Director.All in all, this is a highly recommended text for anyone interested in this stage craft. It's invaluable for any small theater company that has no fight director but wants to present convincing, dramatically powerful fights without putting their actors in the hospital.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Just finished an Adult Bible Study on the History of the Crusades, and this volume helped me the most. It has all the elements that one would expect in a well done primer, engagement with the views, and precise presentation on what this Crusade historian believes is the history. From the motivation to the legacy, this is absolutely well done. He does no glossing over historic movements, but rather presents the typical complex matrix of factors that entered into histories moments.I especially appreciated his recommendations for further study after each chapter as well as class discussion questions as well. If I would suggest one book to read on Crusades, this would be it, a great starting point.Only comment would be that he would have spent more time on what led up to the Crusades, i.e. Islam's advance of territory from 7th to 11th Centuries.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Firstly, I love minimalism.

I found a lot of inspiration looking at these designs, and the photography is mostly great.BUT, you really don't need to buy this particular book. I suggest Minimalist Houses over this particular collection because it has a lot more variety, and greater international representation (eg. you'll see more from Germany, Sweedan, the U.S. and Japan) for about the same price.

This book mixes humor with sadness and can be an inspiration for anybody with a life goal.In this book the main character has to survive a rough childhood in the 1950's. He endures constantly moving, separation from his father and brother, an abusive stepfather, and a bad high school experience. This is about the hardships some have to endure before they're old enough to understand.This book can put a person in the mind of the boy and gives insight on a child who wouldn't give up. His goals were to achieve social status and to some day make a name for himself. This is the story of someone who was willing to do whatever it took to come out on top.He tries and tries to become better. Every time he moves or meets someone new, he presented himself differently than ever before. He wanted so much just to be cool, and he refused to become discouraged. He had a never ending supply of motivation he kept drawing from.This book is so much more than a simple tale of an unhappy boy, but a glorious telling of a victorious young man trying to make something of himself in the world. This is about how someone, anyone, can make their dream come true.There's no such thing as impossible, only the currently unattainable. Most people take a lifetime to realize that it's okay to accomplish a goal you set. They can't understand it's alright to reward themselves for the little things. But Toby found that it's alright to have a goal you want to accomplish before he was through with high school.It's such a moving, heartbreaking book. It isn't just the story of a childhood, but an example of triumph and failure, victory and defeat, succeeding and falling short. This is the story of a man who prevailed not just because he was great, but because he managed to survive.Anybody who has ever wanted something, but was too afraid to go after it, this book is for you.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"\"A Clockwork Orange\" is a novel by Anthony Burgess, and it is one of the most famous works of dystopian fiction. It has been made particularly famous by Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation, and both the film and the book are routinely ranked in various surveys amongst the most significant works in their corresponding genres.One of the main idiosyncrasies of the book is the use of an invented teenage slang (or more specifically \"argot\") called Nadsat. Burgess was a polyglot, so for him it was an interesting exercise to create a whole new manner of speaking. Nadsat was largely based on Russian words with a few traditional English slang words and phrases. One of the motivations for the invention of a completely fictional slang was Burgess' desire to keep his characters fresh and relevant for a foreseeable future. Thus, a use of any concurrent argots would have made book dated very quickly. However, the heavy use of Nadsat makes \"A Clockwork Orange\" fairly difficult to read. My native language is Croatian, another Slavic tongue, and I found that I was able to understand majority of the Russian words without a need for a glossary. Nonetheless, the Anglicized orthography of the words made them sufficiently alien to me that I needed to pause and think about the meaning of those words as I was reading. If you are not familiar with any Slavic languages, then either try to go through a glossary of Nadsat words or try to figure their meaning out from the context.If you can get past the language then \"A Clockwork Orange\" will present you with one of the most innovative and original works of fiction in the twentieth century. Burgess' ability to completely get into the head of a delinquent youth is astounding and has not lost any of its original freshness. Even in the age when we are bombarded with violent images in the media on a daily basis, the descriptions of \"ultraviolence\" is still very unsettling and disturbing. One of the book's main themes is a reform of violent offenders, and the ethics of the use of behavioral conditioning as a form of rehabilitation. This is what the title of the book refers to: clockwork orange is an unnatural combination of mechanical clockwork, and a soft, juicy living organism. The contradiction between these two opposing forces creates unresolvable tension that can only end in a disaster.Despite its innovative use of language, futuristic setting, and the graphical description of violence, \"A Clockwork Orange\" is essentially a classic morality play. This is probably one of the main reasons for book's enduring popularity and relevance. Themes of youthful alienation, repentant malefactors, and individual's moral progress are universally relatable and applicable. This alone makes this book worth reading and all the effort worthwhile.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Although Mr. Garrison's text seems to be well-researched, it does not reflect the quality of workmanship one would expect of someone with his credentials. It reads more like a printed collection of notes intended to be used in preparation of a book than the intended finished product, especially the 2nd Edition of a prior publication.While appearing to be well-researched, the text is filled with grammatical and stylistic errors such as incomplete sentences, improper punctuation, mixed metaphors, incoherent mixing of units of measure, unknown or undefined abbreviations, non sequiturs, and a host of other errors that would support several weeks of discussion in a college expository or technical writing course.While I found the book generally informative, the frequency and nature of the stylistic problems makes for somewhat disjointed reading, and calls into question the quality of the underlying research.

I hope this will not be the last Susan Kay book I have the pleasure to read.Kay explains the birth and formative years of the person we will eventually know as The Phantom of the Opera. The first chapter is voiced by Erik's mother. The second by Erik. The voice of each chapter is announced on a front piece. I do not recall ever having such intense feelings for or about so many characters in one book. My emotions ran the gamut from disgust to compassion to joy to sorrow.

Pinto-Correia mixes a bit of humor with a pleasant writing style, lots of relevant history and geography, and a sad shake of her head about how rapacious humans are.It was a marvelously heady period in Europe's awakening after intellectual dark days and Pinto-Correia gives the reader a sense of that emergence. On one level the dodo is a symbol of an eden found and lost on three small islands along the way to spices and riches. In their rush to gather spices, riches and glory men plundered these islands and left them poorer - the islands' inhabitants were decimated and became fearful, the men did not realize what a treasure they had found.The reader can assign other levels to the story as Pinto-Correia unfolds it. Science came into its own during these centuries, and the dodo's discovery and extinction is a grand example of the days when alchemy gave way to chemistry and astrology became astronomy. Natural history developed as well, with taxonomy seemingly in the forefront. The dodo was classified and plunged into first one species then another, had little to prove that it even existed, finally was declared extinct - all in less than 100 years.Pinto-Correia packs information about the hapless bird and the European humans of the era into this book. The reader learns painlessly while realizing this is a learning experience.For this reader Return of the Crazy Bird is a grand vacation read, easy to pick up and put down without losing the thread of the story.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Warning: this book is too religious for a scientist and too scientific for a religious person. For those, like me, who have a love and interest for the study of both psychology and religion, this is THE book on the psychology of religion. This book is the fruits of William James' appointment as Gifford Lecturer. The Gifford Lectures are a series of talks that have been given for the past century on natural theology at prestigious European universities.James eloquently outlines many, hundreds, of writings from the religious public. His list includes Jonathan Edwards, Martin Luther, Thomas Aquinas, Augustine and other prominent religious thinkers personal experience with their faith. Among these prominent members many more experiences from the common man are laid out in this book.James leaves doctrine and creed out of his observation and focuses strictly on individuals reported experience with their religious beliefs.James focus on experience and his use of self reports, memoirs and autobiographical writing can seem to go overboard at times. Those who follow James will find themselves skipping through the religious testimonies to hear James critique, which can be rather short at times. Nonetheless James offers a fairly objective critique of the experiences individuals have found within religious systems.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"The book is a very candid narration of the spiritual journey of a western seeker.

The author does a fine job conveying the varied emotions of the characters, especially those of Captain O'Thames from childhood through adulthood. There is plenty of action in the book and the plot and subplots move along well. This is a book that the reader will want to read again \"in case the reader has missed something,\" and a second reading is just as much fun.

Emphasis on caring for others, and the crowds you hang out with helps pinpoint everyday life. Oliver Twist is a young orphan of which brings the story to a humble attitude. The four stars cannot explain how well narrated this story was. Characters such as mean old Mr. Bumble, the parish official, and Fagin, the trouble maker, allow the story to have a unique blend of traits. With this mix of personalities, the story flows smoothly, and allows the reader to connect certain aspects with the world around us. Oliver is treated to a very low standard, until caring others help save and nourish him to be a fine young boy. This helped boost my regards for the story itself, and compelled me to keep reading, as the mischief grew.On top of that, this classic shows that even from the dumps, you can rise to be amazing. Twist's life is a horrid run, where as a child he is sold and bartered from factories to workshops. His determination kept my nose in the book, as he endured treacherous adventures, such as getting shot, and living with a pack of thieves. No matter what though he kept striving, till he ended up with a home, family, and inheritance. This book shows kindness such as that of Mr. Brownlow, taking Oliver in, teaching him the ways of life, and this trek definitely deserves its upper rating and the recommendation stars. This book did not catch me by its vocabulary, but rather the tale and story line itself, which in the end made you want to cheer. \"Give me some ore, please\" was Twist's words, but through the plot you will see that even after the loss of his mother, he strove, through the Undertakers life, a scoundrel's, and finally to a handsome young child.If you have read this book and found it to your liking, I would recommend The Time Machine, By HG Wells, Tom Sawyer, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and other classics, preferably by Charles Dickens. To rap it up, I myself am a twelve year old North Carolina middle school student, in seventh grade. I enjoy being outdoors, reading, playing with building mechanisms, writing stories, and overall, life is great!","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"A classic for a reason.

Although nothing close to Karyn's it is a bill that is overpowering my life. I was not going to read this book at first and just give it back after attempting it, but once I started reading I was hooked. Each purchase she made was like wow she really has some balls to spend that much. I thought spending $25 on a hair cut was crazy but $300+ was worse. It was insane. I am honestly suprised by how many people actually helped her out. I think the world is better than I pictured it. I envied her for going on to a place where she knew no one and starting a life an expensive one but at least she had the guts to do it. I was actually jealous of her in some parts expecially when she was shopping and getting great brands because there is no way I could afford Gucci but that doesn't mean I don't dream about owning a piece one day. One thing I didn't envy is the bill she got after her shopping sprees. Sometiems I honestly wondered if she had a head on her I would want to be \"perfet\" too but I think I would also rather have a bed and necessities before I got friviouls.All in all I thought the book was good a little dry towards the end but extremely hilarious in the parts before that. I would recommend that everyone read this book you might come out learning some or a lot about a shopper and their addictions.(p.s. I think she should write a follow up. I am curious if she went back to her old ways with all the money from this book or if she really did change her ways her website is vague when it comes to that.)","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Okay, so the book has a few drags. Yes, the CDs have to be ordered separately from Cornell University Language Center, and yes, it will cost you extra. And for those of you who are thinking of learning Arabic by yourselves, this is not the book to use.I was taught using this book (in fact, by the author himself), but I have both volumes of al-Kitab and I've studied with it as well. I would say al-Kitab has better layout and overall a better looking production, but a pretty book isn't necessarily a good book. I have been a language teacher myself, and in my opinion Dr. Younes' book is the right approach to learning languages. If you study with al-Kitab, you will know by heart inane grammar rules that Arabs themselves don't bother with much of the time, but you will not be able to sustain a conversation with a taxi driver for more than half a minute should you ever find yourself in the Middle East.This book, on the other hand, has the right mixture of written and spoken Arabic, and the content is closer to what you will encounter in real life. There is a reason why the first book of the series is called \"Living Arabic.\" It's a little thin on grammar, but you'll learn enough to be able to read and speak without problems. Anyway, I'm of the opinion that focusing on grammar more than what is necessary impedes language learning.I heard that the author is preparing a new edition, so hopefully he will make some improvements there.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"In this book you will learn the life of Taran.

It is an amazing novel, capturing the reader and drawing them into Cathy and Heathcliff's world, devided between the two contrasting houses of Thrushcross Grange and Wuthering Heights. The writing style of Bronte conveys the emotion extremley well throughout the intricate and intertwining storylines. The story is told over the course of two generations, in the moors of England, creating a good backdrop for such a story. It is, in my opinion deserving of its status and leaves the reader with thoughts regarding fate and predestination. A dramatic and sadenning book, Wuthering Heights is a novel which, at the time it was published pushed back the barriers of what was considered &quot;acceptable&quot; in literature.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Narratively speaking, it's no more than an average story. In fact, there are many plot gaps and false steps. But the implications itself are staggering. Somewhere along the way, this book becomes less science fiction and more science fact. Orwell accurately predicts the advent of things like \"perpetual wars\" -- not for the sake of winning, but for the sake of warring for profit, and \"doublespeak,\" or, as we refer to it now, political euphemisms, or \"political correctness.\" When our politicians sidestep an uncomfortable question by answering one that was not asked instead? that is Orwellian. Even the questioner, apparently, has forgotten what he or she just asked. And when the motive behind a question becomes the question itself, supplanting the original, that too is Orwellian. The removal of certain words from the english language to cover up crimes? It's Orwellian, and comes straight out of 1984 -- as when torture suddenly becomes \"harsh interrogation techniques.\" And it is happening more and more; more, perhaps than we'd like to admit. For the good of more, the less are squashed, and the president mangles his principles. There are many people today who believe wholly in a past which in fact never actually existed -- unless it was on shows life Leave it to Beaver and Father knows Best.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"God is in control. God is sovereign and the creator of the universe. God sustains His creation and is active in His creation, whether he chooses to use ordinary or extraordinary means (miracles).God is omniscience. God knew before the creation everything what was to be and all the alternatives. God is the same today, tomorrow, and yesterday. God is immutable. God does not change; Man changes constantly. God is self existent; Man is a created being. Man has a body, soul, and is created in God's image. The author of the book makes a distinction that man is made not created since God brought man into being from dust not exnihilo. Man was brought into existence through extraordinary means, but not created as the universe was. The dust was created, man was made. Substance started to exist when God created the universe. Man is dependent on God. God is self existent and self sustaining. God is spirit; Man is body and soul. J. Gresham Machen does not accept the theology that man is body, soul, and spirit. When Spirit is mentioned in the New Testament it is referring to the Holy Spirit- not man's spirit. The author also goes into a detail discussion about the brain, mind, and soul. A distinction is made between the physical means of thought and the thought of man constructed through the soul. The mind is part of the soul not the body. The theme of this book is about the distinction between God's perspective and being as compared to and in relationship to man's perspective and being. God is sovereign because he is all powerful and all knowing while man is neither. Calvinistic view of predestination is defended and a major factor in this book. This are written transcripts of messages given by J. Gresham Machen, but I thought it was a well written and organized work on topic.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Yes, this book is missing some of the more intimate and probably painful details of Karen's life.

Through the narratives of Bansir, and his broke musician friend, we can see the standard folk who try to figure out how to get out of debt, the salary slavery and to finally attain wealth. Clason also uses the narrative of the richest man in Babylon Arkad who was initially poor but later learnt how to accumulate wealth. Through Arkad, the rest of Babylon gets to understand the secrets of wealth accumulation.Clason's book is a timeless classic and most of its message still holds true today. It teaches the values of saving, overcoming poor habits such as procrastination and being able to take advantage of opportunities. It is amazing how he was able to vividly elucidate the Babylonian lifestyle, as if he were there in that society. However, importantly, he was able to bring out these timeless values that anyone can apply today and in years to come. It is interesting that the ancient idea of compounding is what we today see as saving or making an investment.I highly recommend this simple book to anyone who may be looking for inspiration on how to accumulate wealth. Nevertheless, the idea here is to put what you learn into practice to see any results.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Tony Robbins is the best software upgrade on the planet for the mental hardware we call the human mind.Since using his tapes I'm the same person I was before, only now I enjoy healthy things rather than unhealthy, I enjoy taking positive action instead of negative (goodbye road rage and panic attacks!) and I am no longer so selfish.... in fact, now my life is dedicated to contributing to others through the net.Tony has a great eye for what actually works and the fact that he found things that work and put them together so beautifully has dramatically changed my life for the better.If you buy the tapes and don't listen too them - you're wasting your money.

The author is an experienced investigative reporter and an unashamed proponent of sustainable agriculture and the ever-dwindling \"family\" farmer representative of traditional crop cultivation in the United States. As such, Diet For A Dead Planet is a bit of a polemic and firmly in the camp of other books critical of the relationship between agricultural economics and modern food production, such as Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation. Needless to say, Cargill and Archer-Daniels Midland executives are not going to be enamored of Diet, but any citizen concerned about the state of farming in the US, and its effects on public health and environmental well-being, would do well to read this book.Cook organizes his topic into three sections, dealing with food quality and safety; the business and economic aspects of modern agriculture; and environmental consequences of profligate pesticide use and \"factory\" farm effluents. Each section contains several chapters with extensive footnotes. The chapters are obviously targeted for a general audience, and as a consequence are very readable without overwhelming the reader with statistics and technical jargon. In particular, I found the chapters on the evolving history of American agriculture offered a concise but informative account of a complex and often tumultuous subject. Other chapters on such diverse subjects as the \"mad cow\" crisis, the continuous deposition of toxic pesticides in water supplies, and the travails of workers in high-throughput slaughterhouse operations, are all eye-opening to one degree or another.Cook ends the book with a admonition to the public: unless we actively choose to support organic \/ sustainable farm operations, our health and the welfare of the environment we live in are not going to improve. Rather than simple hectoring, however, in the last segment of the book he provides an extensive listing of whole-food organizations and advocacy groups dedicated to helping us change the way we eat and consume natural resources. There is of course an element of \"better to light one candle\" rhetoric here; even Cook is not so nave as to think that tomorrow will see the US converted to any kind of enormous vegan commune. But his hope is that after reading Diet some of us will devote a bit of thought to the hows and whys of our eating habits, and in this, I think he is as realistic as any \"muckraker\" can be.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I have been wanting to read this book so finally ordered it.

Is a must read for anyone, whether you are gregarious and get along with everyone or if you are constantly at the center of disagreements.This isn't a how to book to solve all your conversational woes. Honestly, I would never expect something so simple as a step-by-step guide for something as complex as conversation. Considering that, Deborah Tannen does an excellent job of showing just how complex a simple conversation can be and how things can go wrong despite everyone's best intentions.This is the only one of Deborah Tannen's books that I have read. And it is the perfect mix of all relevant conversations that most people encounter in their lives. From talking with teenagers to business conversations to gripes from long-time spouses.The result of reading this book has especially helped me feel more comfortable about my conversation skills. Before I read this book, I thought I was the only one that was no good at getting my intentions across clearly, but now that I have learned that confusion is inevitable I finally believe everyone that has said that I'm actually pretty normal and surprisingly flexible in my style (most likely because I was so hard on myself before). It also gave me some ideas on how to better get along with some of the people that I previously thought were too pushy or quiet etc.I just finished this book for the first time(I'm planning on reading it again) and I am still absorbing much of the content.

Stands up well next to other crack up tales like I Never Promised You a Rose Garden and even the movie Frances. Hollywood loves to chew some of its members to pieces, doesn't it? Makes you seriously wonder why anyone would want to be famous? PS: the only nitpicky part I didn't enjoy was that poem Suzanne wrote while tripping in Mexico. Did that really need to be published in this book?

An early holistic practitioner, she used stones, crystals, herbs, words and music in her healing art. Strehlow's book is based upon Hildegard's Book Of Values In Life, in which she discusses 35 risk factors that are harmful to humanity plus the 35 healing forces that counteract these negatives.The book makes the connection between physical illness and the sickness of the soul and recommends Hildegard's spiritual remedies instead of surgery, chemical treatment and radiation. The mind controls the body, in particular the autonomic nervous system and all major systems like digestion, sexuality and the immune system. This ties in with modern theories on spiritual healing, like psycho-neuro-immunology. Hildegard's wisdom connects the 35 vertebrae of the spinal cord to the aforementioned 35 spiritual forces of the human body, making clear the connection to every organ.These 35 factors are discussed in chapters 3 - 7: The Eastman, The Westman, the Northman, The Southman and The New Elders' Ascent To The Summit under sections titled Crystal Therapy, Harmful Words, Healing Words, Organ Relationship and Spiritual Healing. Chapter 6: Fasting, deals with fasting as a way to discover one's true personality. Throughout, the importance of the unity of the body, mind, and soul is stressed. Good health is the result of the right ordering of the relationship of the emotional, physical, mental and spiritual dimensions into a harmonious whole.For a general introduction and overview of Hildegard's various writings, I recommend the book Selected Writings: Hildegard of Bingen (Penguin Classics) by Mark Atherton. I would also like to recommend the CD Monk And The Abbess. This remarkable album contains four of her compositions: O Quam Mirabilis (Antiphon for the Creator), O Ecclesia (Sequence for St. Ursula), O Clarissima Mater (Responsory for the Virgin) and Tu Illustrata (Antiphon for the Virgin), exquisitely performed by the great musician Meredith Monk. Monk and the Abbess is a highly inspiring album and should appeal to those who appreciate vocal medieval and classical music.In The Spiritual Remedies, Strehlow succeeds in making accessible the wisdom and insight of this medieval visionary in a practical and useful manner, highly relevant to our time. The text is enhanced with plenty of black and white illustrations. The book contains biographical notes on the author and on Hildegard and concludes with an extensive bibliography and a thorough index.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"The Blue Guide series focuses on art. If you are looking for hotels, shopping, restaurants, or for entertaining reading, rely on something else. If you're looking for history and art, both the well-known and the quietly tucked away, a list of hours and days open for musuems, holidays (often to be avoided!), as well as addresses of libraries and research institutions, the Blue Guides are for you. They cover almost every artwork in the various regions, and do so accurately. The books guide the reader systematically through churches and museums and include accurate floor plans. Towns are grouped into touring areas, as are neighborhoods in the large cities. Town maps, even for little places, are precise and plentiful. City maps are equally precise and inclusive, even for Venice and Siena,but they are split among several pages, which can make them a harder to follow --- a minor flaw.

Many indicate that they come back to this novel again and again. I found myself thinking, however, that this might not have been necessary if the author had been less ambiguous, more specific. Ostensibly the story of four students, one of whom has disappeared, during a time of political tumult, the book explores philosophy, politics, social upheavals, the characters and their inner lives, the historical past and its effect on the present, the specific mystery of Immanuele and her fate, the relationship between love and death, the connections between physical and idealistic love, the effects of fear, the relationships between dreams\/reality\/nightmare\/fantasy, the bird and water &quot;symbols&quot; and their possible meanings, etc.Though I liked the book and admired the &quot;reach&quot; of the author, I felt that in many ways the reach was greater than the grasp and that the book was not successful as a novel in its own right.

I buy the Kindle editions in order to easily search for particular quotes and passages. These passages I commonly paste into writings I do on the Bible, and Lewis Carroll's works are some of my favorites, behind Shakespeare and Plato.I mention all this because unlike many other books, this edition is actually better for reading than it is for the purpose I just mentioned, because it does not have the pagination which would enable one to refer back to the original copy. In most Kindle books, you can locate the printed page number by doing a query on a word on that page. That's a bit hokey, but that's what you have to do. That trick does not work on this edition. Rules for scholarly source citations have not yet caught up with editions which are formatted especially for the Kindle.But for reading, the Kindle converters got two things very right. First, the edition has all of Sir John Tenniel's drawings. They didn't even spoil them by having them colorized, even thoughh the thumbnail picture in the Amazon header is colored. Second, formatting for poetry loses absolutely nothing as the size of the page or font is changed. This is especially important for that unique example of \"concrete poetry\", \"A Mouse's Tale\" which appears in chapter III.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Definitive study of Pickett's ChargeEarl Hess's well researched Pickett's Charge--The Last Attack at Gettysburg is the definitive study of Gettysburg's final bloody battle on July 3, 1863. Hess spares no investigative resource in his exhaustive examination of all aspects of this crucial doomed attack. He breaks the attack down along chronological stages while examining all personal and logistical aspects. Mr. Hess further examines all tactical and strategic components of the doomed attack while comparing pros and cons of the event's reality in conjunction with other various possible outcomes. Could Pickett's Charge have worked? What if Pickett's Charge had broken the Union's center, what then? These and a myriad of other cogent questions were both asked and answered by Mr. Hess. Yes, the book is mind-numbing in its exhaustive detail but that is the beauty of this definitive history. Reading it I found myself totally immersed in the events of that hot July day when Marse Robert sent his wonderful boys to assault the unassailable, knowing that the possibility of victory was slight but still doing their duty in light of the most difficult of odds. Could success have been achieved? Yes, but everything had to go perfectly--IT DIDN'T. Mr. Hess's up close and personal examination of this horrific event was both illuminating and instructive. 5+ stars for a very well done historical monograph of the first order.Excellent in-depth analysis of not only the attack but also of the individuals involved. I liked how Mr. Hess informed the reader what happened to the various players after Gettysburg. I also liked how Mr. Hess discussed the insider bickering that follows every major historical event. Nothing ends with the last shot, there are always loose ends, blame, intrigue, what-ifs, dissembling, parsing, misinformation and yes even disinformation. History is written by the victors. Further, history is not what happened per se but rather what was \/is written down. Mr. Hess cuts through the fog of Pickett's Charge to present an accurate portrayal of those most difficult hours on a very hot July 3rd afternoon. Good use of maps to keep the reader orientated and wonderful presentation of photographs to give the reader a personal connection to the men involved. Abundant facts and statistics that gives depth to the author's assertions and What If scenarios. I liked that Mr. Hess did NOT write from the typical POST analysis \"the-attack-was-doomed\" view. Rather, he presented the facts with clarity and critical analysis, and viewed the event from the perspective of the historical times involved. Mr. Hess is not a revisionist, but rather a critical chronicler of the event-A historical objectivist if you will. Most refreshing compared to the plethora of nuanced, subjective, historical relativism that dominates so many \"sophisticated\" histories today.Still, as I read Hess's account of Pickett's, Pettigrew's, and Trimble's men stepping off into glory I couldn't help but think of the immortal words of William Faulkner from his novel Intruder in the Dust, \"....This Time. Maybe This Time...\"Must read for Civil War history buffs. This is the definitive study of Pickett's Charge and will only gain in historical stature. Well done Earl Hess.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I've only read it fifty or more times. At one time in my life I read it through and started right over again at the end. I could recite large portions of it, as well as the table of contents.I first read this when I was about eight. I didn't understand it at all. Re-read it when I was a few years older and couldn't live without it. My grandma sent me a copy which I later replaced with a better one (the old version of the Children's Classics series) and I passed my first copy on to another LW admirer.I've always enjoyed this book. I remember being thrilled when I was fifteen like Jo is at the beginning of the book. I always liked Jo best... because I felt I was very like her. I've always liked to write. But then the artist in Amy appealed to me as well. I always loved Beth also and her dolls and cats. Meg was the only one I never felt I could relate to... later on though I re-read the book after a long absence from it and Meg's character seemed much more interesting. There's a charming supporting cast in these pages too... Laurie, John, and the Bhaer... Hannah... Aunt March...I like the Pilgrim's Progress theme of the first half of the book. I think it's so nice that these were four girls who really wanted to do right... and went to the right place for help - the little Books Mother gave them under their pillows... There is humour and sadness here, much reality, and plenty of charm. I always appreciated the simple but profound style of Louisa May Alcott - it bears up under so many readings very well.

It follows the interesting story of a boy named Pip throughout his many life experiences and different phases of his expectations. The plot is connected in a unique way throughout the book, and mysteries are solved and connected with it. Through his beautiful writing and interesting plot, this novel is arguably Dickens's greatest work. The language does require your full attention to understand it, and it is a very long book, but the writing is so great that you don't really notice to much.The tone of the novel is pretty dark and gloomy, but there is a constant sense of hope throughout. With themes of social class, guilt and innocence, and ambition we see Pip grow as a person and learn about the struggles and trials in life. There is also a bit of a love story that occurs that puts some fey real emotion into the story.I would reccomend this book to younng adults and adults who have the ability to understand the writing.

As he declares in his introduction, he sticks to scripture and personal revelation of its interpretation and shares the truth he has gleaned fromhis vast biblical knowledge with his readers.Highly recommended for anyone who desires to connect the Old Testament with the New and find the fulfillment of Christ as seen in the law and in the construction of the temple. It is not a difficult book to read, and there are many references given to scripture passages used in his interpretations so that the reader can cross reference and compare. It would make a great individual study or group study.I would also recommend it for pastors --- no matter what the degree of their education. It is a tremendous book for comparing the development of a church with the building of a temple. Example: Bunyan speaks of those who built the temple and those within the church today. \"All sons are servants, but not all servants are sons.\" It is not enough to enter the \"outer court\" --- that doesn't cost much. The \"inner court\" is the place of sacrifice. I would think a presentation of this would be a great way to challenge any congregation to examine their place in worship.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"There have been many novels written about the horrors of war in the 20th century, and in my opinion, &quot;Catch-22&quot; is the best one. Heller adopts a completly original style for this work. He takes scenes of outrageous comedy and mixes them together with brutal descriptions of violent conflict. The contrast keeps the reader off balance; you never know what to expect next. Heller's amazing talent as a writer comes through in almost every paragraph. His dialogue is believable, sharp, and witty; his word choice is very precise; and his descriptions are incredibly powerful. Perhaps the most amazing thing about the novel is the way that Heller juggles his gigantic cast of characters.So, should you buy &quot;Catch-22&quot;? Here are a couple sample paragraphs. If you find these to be funny, you will enjoy the entire novel.&quot;Major Major had been born too late and too mediocre. Some men are born mediocre, some men achieve mediocrity, and some men have mediocrity thrust upon them. With Major Major it had been all three. Even among men lacking all distinction he inevitably stood out as one lacking more distinction than all the rest, and people who met him were all impressed by how unimpressive he was.Major Major's father was a sober God-fearing man whose idea of a good joke was to lie about his age. He was a long-limbed farmer, a God-fearing, freedom-loving, law-abiding rugged individualist who held that federal aid to anyone but farmers was creeping socialism. He advocated thrift and hard work and disapproved of loose women who turned him down. His specialty was alfalfa and he made a good thing out of not growing any of it. The government paid him well for every bushel of alfalfa that he did not grow. The more alfalfa he did not grow, the more the government gave him, and he spent every penny he didn't earn on new land to increase the amount of alfalfa he did not produce. Major Major's father worked without rest at not growing alfalfa. On long winter evenings he remained indoors and did not mend harness, and he sprang out of bed at the crack of noon every day just to make certain that the chores would not be done. He invested in land wisely and soon was not growing more alfalfa than any other man in the county. Neighbors sought him out for advice on all subjects, for he had made much money a was therefore wise. &quot;As ye sow, so shall ye reap,&quot; he counseled one and all, and everyone said, &quot;Amen.&quot;","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"In the book &quot;Return of the Native&quot;, Thomas Hardy created a good premise and characters one can grow quite attached to. It seems, however, that it takes a long time for the book to get into the plot and once it's there it moves very quickly. Once the book reaches the plot, some reader might get lost. The plot seemed to revolve around the love web between Clym, Eustacia, Wildeve, and Thomasin. Seeing the way they treated each other, many readers would probably question the existance of true love between any of those four. Many may feel that the only character who showed true love was Diggory Venn, a reddleman considered scum by the general society around him. He didn't try to have Thomasin when he knew she would not be happy with him. He even helped her try to have a good relationship with Wildeve. Though you may find yourself attached to the characters, the kindest heart beats within the lowly reddleman, who probably was part of the best love affair Hardy created in his book.","sentiment_score":0.6},{"review":"I have been a fan of Bentley Little's ever since I read The Revelation - which was a fairly standard horror story with a terrifying twist.

This story and the \"Jack Randa Hotel\" seem to me pretty artificial and contrived, whereas Munro seems at her best in \"Open Secrets\" , \"Vandals\" , and \"A Wilderness Station\" - here the lives of common women take on a mysterious, sometimes demonic quality, the pressure of taboos and fears can become overwhelming.In all these stories some aspects are taken up repeatedly: women in their relationships to men, women full of possiblities when they are girls, but then they have to adapt themselves to the world, which is shown as run by men, women tortured by fantasies and taboos. Often the men are presented rather unfavourably and women as the ones who are active or superior yet dependent on men. The sense of reality is mostly extraordinary, but sometimes the stories seem to me to be a bit too vague and myterious (e.g. \"Spaceships have Landed\").","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"At first, this book reads like a typical romantic drama, a page-turner and a mystery rolled into one.

If you don't like the crime genre, though, I would you against this collection. If you prefer literature, you'll find them fatuous. They are, I suppose - they mean little and the characters are pretty hollow when it comes right down to it. However, if you want a good series of shocks and surprises, this really is the collection for you. It is EXCELLENT in that respect.Some of the stories are absolutely excellent. For example, \"Triangle\" is possible a work of crime-writing genius. Absolutely brilliant. Every story has an unexpected twist. It's possible that you may be able to guess a couple, as you gradually work your way into Deaver's mindset, as I did, but even seeing twists coming, I think, gives you a great sense of satisfaction. There are one or two entertaining oddities, too. \"All The World's A Stage\" is a historical crime story, in which Shakespeare pops up. Some of the dialogue is laughable, the historical detail suspect, but the story itself is absolutely cracking. Despite it's flaws, it's very fine entertainment indeed.They're written excellently, in just the way crime short stories should be. Every sentence is telling; every sentence has its function and does its work. Characters are developed as well as they can be in such small frames, and plots are wrought well too.The only problem with a collection like this, is that, when stripped down, all 16 stories are rather similar, certainly in their devices. If you read this book as you would a novel, all in one go, I can imagine them getting pretty repetitive. It is probably best to read a story every couple of days. That's what I did, and I really enjoyed this.

Sheriff Ben Stillman has plenty of suspects in this swift page turner, and there are more twists and turns than an eight second bullride.The story moves at a very quick pace. The action is rather violent, capturing the essence of the old West. Sheriff Stillman is the central figure in this Western mystery. He is trying to figure out just who murdered Suthern, an old rancher with plenty of people out for his property. The suspects range from his deadbeat son to a few of his workers and even his potential son-in-law.As the story moves along, multiple people are shot, double-crossed, swindled, and threatened. It's a pretty good read for anyone who enjoys Westerns. The thing that sets this book apart from others is the mystery in the murder. Honestly, there are a ton of suspects, and this makes for a good story. This story also has a humorous side to it thanks to Doc Evans, who tags along with Stillman through much of the book. The only real gripe I have with this book is that the ending is rather abrupt as far as the murder mystery is concerned.Recommended to lovers of Western novels, but other folks may want to stay away.","sentiment_score":0.6},{"review":"Just finished the latest masterpiece from Tepper - and if you're a fan, this book is a must-read!

The major plot line (recovery of the Eagle) begins quite deeply in the book, which will also make it hard for young readers to stay interested.That being said, the plot is exciting, the characters real (if stuffy) and likable, and the details are accurate to known history.","sentiment_score":0.6},{"review":"A fine book, with &quot;classic&quot; Oates ominousness, now offset with another vision at the end.

Each of these stories is wonderful in it's own right, but I enjoyed the short story \"Rumpole and the Angel of Death\" the most. Rumpole is totaly endearing, and we still see the old spirit where he won't sit still and stand for something if it's something he doesn't believe in. He is also not deterred from extraneous personalities and lies in his search for the truth. He has a habit of being able to get to the nut of every matter, and lay everyone's subterfuge away, so that the truth will out.

It took me about a week to read, and let me say, I was very happy to find out that this book was in a series because I loved it so much. It is very simple reading, yet the story is amazing.

The book center around the \"gift\" Harper developed after being hit by lightning. She can now locate corpses and find out their cause of death.

The premise of the book is that after spending almost six decades working with U.S. Robots, Susan Calvin is on the verge of retirement. A reporter has been assigned to write an article about Calvin for the Interplanetary Press and he seeks her out to flush out the biographical information he already has about her. What follows are nine separate tales about robots who didn't respond and react in ways that a robot would and should typically. The stories are tied together because they are all incidents that happened during or just preceding Calvin's time at U.S. Robots. The stories also illustrate the importance of the Three Laws of Robotics and how those laws affect the ways that robots react: from a robot who seems to love a little girl to a robot that tells people lies to a possible robot who dabbles in politics. The stories are intriguing and rather imaginative, especially considering they were originally written around half a century ago. They are also fairly short and it doesn't take long to read the novel: I read I, ROBOT in less than a week reading for less than an hour a day. I, ROBOT is a great book to introduce oneself to the writing of Isaac Asimov.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"\"Shackleton's Stowaway\" is a fabulous piece of historical fiction.

In what should have been a sickening foray into the dark underbelly of the surreal crime world, Burgess leads his readers to find the essentiality of choice and the importance of living life for the good and bad. Although many graphic images can have a stomach-turning effect on the reader, the overall motive of the book remains intact through the clever use of language and subtle humor. What is unique to this book is the way in which the reader may choose how he would like it to end by simply ignoring the addendum of the last chapter or reading on. Depending on this choice, the book can mean very different things, and that is a feature not found in many other works. There are books that are worth reading for their social commentary, others for their wit, and still others for their surrealism; A Clockwork Orange is truly all of these and more. It is a must-read for anyone who loves true literature.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"The intensity of the blizzard of 1888 is so mind-boggling, that is could only be equated to the cliche of a perfect storm. Even as the words on each page describe the storm, it is hard to imagine. Particularly in simpler lives of the 19th century, one has to wonder how people were able to survive such a storm even under the best of circumstances.David Laskin does a commendable job of explaning the circumstances of the storm to make it fathomable even to whose only knowledge or only care of meteorology is tomorrow's temperature. While at later points he becomes a little more bogged in details, I believe he reaches a fair balance. The story alternatives between those that forcasted or failed to forcast the storm and the people that endured the storm. The bureaucracy of military making weather predictions may have conspired against the people as much as the beautiful day the preceded the storm.No story is more tragic that reading of children dying. The fact that the blizzard errupted when school was dismissing and so many children were trapped in the elements earned the storm and this book its name. As I read these stories, I sometimes felt a disconnect because their were so many names. This is almost more alarming because of the scattering of records and the lack of an accurate count of the dead.Laskin has written a commendable book in \"The Children's Blizzard\". While his writing career seems more tailored toward weather events in history, I would embrace future works in a similar vein to this book.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"A book has not entertained me as much since first reading Starship Troopers many years ago.

Our freewheeling thoughts, emotions, and hatreds which can be broadly termed &quot;karmic hinderances.&quot; In all Buddhist books I have read so far, they say that when karmic hinderances arise, let them pass without clinging.

The issues of missing text are fixed at least in a spot-check of the opening chapter. I just checked with a new download via the PG website of a 1.72 mb file. But, as of today, you have to do it yourself, not via the instant function here. (Amazon's site is not aligned to do this as of this date of writing. I note as I write this Amazon posted a note that the Kindle free [aka Project Gutenberg] text is not available and that they are looking into reported problems as an \"item under review.\")I had first downloaded the free file a few weeks ago (pg4300.mobi @ 1.7 mb) to my Touch. I found that in the the Martello scene, for instance, \"The Ballad of Joking Jesus\" sung memorably by Malachi was missing. Other ditties, such as \"I am the boy...invisibility\") indicated by indentation in standard form (even in the e-book online via Gutenberg-dot-org) were missing as well from the Kindle version of the free text. In other places, if not surprisingly, spacing was off. I assume later chapters may have lacked the graphic designs that the novel relied upon as to punctuation and page presentation. The spacing looks a little better in the updated download. Let's hope these matters have been corrected, thanks to Gutenberg's team of volunteers for a valuable service after so many decades of copyright control beyond reasonable limits exerted by the author's estate against creative uses.One challenge, if not to be blamed on any version of Joyce's text as published originally. The e-books come in parts I (Stephen), II (Bloom) and III (Molly). So, the chapters attributed later on are not included, but they may be on electronic resources that are not the public domain one, as added value. I cannot figure out on a Kindle how to make bookmarks and label them as to chapters--I did this on an Aldiko version on my phone.Finding gratis a public domain (finally!) version despite its drawbacks is wonderful. I cannot fault those who prepared a difficult text for an e-book for free. There are other versions for sale that are nicer, and they merit their own reviews by others, but Amazon heaps all media for many texts in the public domain together, so rating the medium is jumbled with the content itself, no easy solution.Making e-books off of a notoriously unstable ur-text that's long tested the patience of any Joycean editor already isn't easy. So, the bulk of the novel's intact for reference, concordance work, and looking up passages or phrases nearly instantly. It can always be compared to the Gabler or Random House eds., of course. It's great to have my favorite novel even in its rawer form, to look up or dip into on a Kindle.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Tad Williams' Memory, Sorrow, & Thorn trilogy was one of the first fantasy series I ever read and it's still one of my favorites.The writing style is very pleasant and the pace is slow enough to be savored, but characters actually accomplish things by the end of each book (you know what I mean).

In one of the work's defining passages he writes, \".. the art of fiction does not begin until the novelist thinks of the story as a matter to be shown, to be so exhibited that it will tell itself To hand over the reader the facts of the story merely as so much information- this is no more than to state the 'argument' of the book...

It is not the simple art of narrative, but the comprehensive art of fiction that I am considering' and in fiction there can be no appeal to any authority outside the book itself.\"For Lubbock the consummate master of the techniques of 'showing' is James.

In the wake of her parents' death, she and her brother, Robert, have almost nothing. When Robert is kidnapped and Chelsea receives a ransom note demanding five hundred pounds, she has no option but to turn to highway robbery. Unfortunately, one of the coaches Chelsea chooses to rob is the wrong one.Lord Anthony Grenville, Viscount Montrose, is surprised when he and his fianc&eacute;e are set upon by a highwayman. He's even more surprised to find that the highwayman is no man at all. When he catches Chelsea thieving again, this time from his home, he offers to help her rescue her brother. He claims he's helping Chelsea because he's bored, but what he really wants is the beautiful thief as his mistress.I was attracted to A Rogue's Pleasure by its premise and beautiful cover. To my delight, Hope Tarr presented a most entertaining first meeting for its protagonists. How often do you see a Regency heroine robbing the man she'll eventually fall in love with? Sadly, my pleasure in reading Chelsea and Anthony's story was short-lived. A Rogue's Pleasure moved at a slow pace and as much as I wanted to like Chelsea, there were far too many moments in the book where her intelligence seemed to have taken flight just so a certain situation could be set up. Anthony was even harder to like. I understand the plot device of having a hero engaged to one woman and then meeting his heroine. What frustrated me was that he didn't even seem to feel a hint of guilt (or if he did it was so quickly passed over I took no note of it) over trying to make Chelsea his mistress, all the while not telling her he still intended to marry someone else. To make matters worse, he had an awful habit of making assumptions about Chelsea that had no logical basis that I could see.

While searching for Lisa, he enters a strange land and charms Mother Sereda into temporarily giving him back his youth and good looks. Then he uses his renewed vigor to lie and philander his way across a magical landscape, \"dealing fairly\" with all the women he meets, as he half-heartedly searches for his wife. Along the way he meets dozens of historical and mythical creatures and people (including Queen Guenevere, shown in the picture), first introducing himself as a duke, then promoting himself to prince, king, emperor, pope, and eventually, for a moment, even God.Despite being a vain and hypocritical rogue, Jurgen has a sentimental heart (though he can't seem to be faithful). But he is never content, even when he's married to the most beautiful woman he's ever seen, or even when he's sitting on God's throne. Thus, the story of Jurgen is about man's quest for meaning, pleasure, and purpose. Jurgen is full of human insight and amusing social satire and, for a novel written in 1919, is oh so impolite. Much of the symbolism and metaphor is crude and puerile double entendre of the \"big upright lance\" and \"remarkable powers of penetration\" type.Yet, James Branch Cabell (rhymes with \"rabble\") writes in a sardonic voice which is beautiful and genuinely clever and funny, especially when Jurgen talks about women:* I am looking for my wife, whom I suspect to have been carried off by a devil, poor fellow!* Love's sowing is more agreeable than love's harvest.* You talk and talk: no woman breathing equals you at mere volume and continuity of speech: but you say nothing that I have not heard seven hundred and eighty times if not oftener.* \"You have a wife, then!\" says Jurgen, who was always interested in such matters. \"Why, but to be sure! Either as a Christian or as a married man, I should have comprehended this was Satan's due. And how do you get on with her?\"\"Pretty well,\" says Grandfather Satan: \"but she does not understand me.\"\"Et tu, Brute!\" says Jurgen.\"And what does that mean?\"* For the devils, he found, esteemed polygamy, and ranked it above mere skill at torturing the damned, through a literal interpretation of the saying that it is better to marry than to burn.* When Jurgen asks if it's possible to get divorced in Hell, the devils say no because \"we trafficked in them for a while, but we found that all persons who obtained divorces through our industry promptly thanked Heaven...\"I also found it amusing that Jurgen, a pawnbroker with a paunch, backs up his arguments with fake scholarly citations and uses the study of mathematics to seduce intelligent women.Even a well-educated reader will miss most of the allusions in Jurgen unless armed with a source such as David Rolfe's Notes on Jurgen. These notes also point out references to Cabell's previous novels about his fabricated world of Poictesme. Fortunately, understanding of all of these allusions isn't required for enjoyment of the story, but they elicit chuckles when discovered and could be a source of much diversion for those who like to spend time studying these kinds of things.Back in its day, Jurgen was deemed offensive by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, which tried to get it banned. This, of course, only increased Jurgen's popularity. The Vice squad lost their case because, superficially, Jurgen seems harmless enough and, according to Cabell and his publisher, complaints about the recurrent references to Jurgen's big staff, majestic scepter, upright lance, and amazing sword (which seem to meet a lot of veils, sheaths, clefts, and other dark places along the way) prove only that Cabell's detractors have dirty minds.Perhaps the real issue behind the outcry against Jurgen, however, is its disrespect of Christianity and, in particular, the Roman Catholic Church. For, when Jurgen is sent to Hell, he meets Grandfather Satan and learns that Hell is merely a construct developed by men who think so highly of themselves that they feel that their bad deeds were so influential that they cannot be forgotten and must be punished for eternity. The devils that Jurgen meets are hard-pressed to keep up with people's demands for torture, lament that Hell's population is increasing, and look for ways to stop the influx. When Jurgen gets bored of Hell, he talks his way into Heaven and finds that it's just a figment of his grandmother's imagination. His discussions with St. Peter cast an ill light on Catholic bishops and popes.Jurgen is in the public domain and can be downloaded for free at Project Gutenberg. I downloaded the mobipocket version and stuck it right on my Kindle. Besides being free, Jurgen is an interesting and thoughtful novel which is worth reading not just for entertainment, but as part of the history of fantasy literature.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"If you think you can skip the book because you saw the movie. think again.

The jewel, the Moonstone, has become a family heirloom soon to be presented to a young woman as a birthday present. That very evening the Moonstone disappeared leaving behind suspicion and tragedy. A professional detective is called in but before all is revealed there will be deaths and long hidden secrets brought to light.The story was originally published in the mid 1800's which can cause a problem for a modern reader. The style of writing is much more verbose than contemporary readers are accustomed to, the vocabulary is often unfamiliar but perhaps most difficult for the modern reader are the conventions of mid Victorian society. The class distinctions and the restrictions placed on women, particularly young, unmarried women are completely foreign to the 21st century.Despite these challenges THE MOONSTONE is an excellent story on its own merits. The characters are interesting and believeable. The plot is well thought out, full of twists and turns that will keep the reader guessing until the very end. For fans of detective fiction it is interesting to see the various elements of this story and recognize them from their more modern forms.THE MOONSTONE has been called the first detective novel. It introduced many of the characteristics familiar to fans of this genre, the outsider, professional detective, the bumbling, incompetant local police, the clueless sidekick, the red herring clues that lead the reader astray and the premise that all clues must be available for the reader to solve the crime. In that regard THE MOONSTONE has its own unique place in history no matter what the quality of the story itself might be.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"If you like the writings of Thoreau, you will love this biography. Thoreau really comes to life and Walter Harding does a great job at aquainting us with Thoreau as if he were our neighbor or close friend. You will love all the stories of his childhood, his many excursions and his never ending desire for knowledge of nature. Also, at the end Harding dicusses Thoreaus's sexuality, which for me was a burning question throughout the book. There is no better biography out there written on Thoreau.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I've been reading a lot of books like this recently but this one seemed very well balanced. Other books that you might think are about \"randomness\" are about Wall St. psychology or medical diagnoses or are standard dull opaque textbooks. This book is quite readable and is about general topics involving randomness, as advertised by the title. A book like this can't go into excruciating details about things like Kolmogorov complexity, but it is mentioned and even explained. I rather liked that it didn't get bogged down with formulas and proofs. Instead it tried to make the whole pursuit of statistics and probability interesting by following along the path of human technological development. By giving some historical context to the various developments in how people have thought about randomness, it's easier to see *why* any of it matters. I think this would be a good book to read just before taking a statistics class if you are actually interested in statistics. After reading this book, the cold mathematical treatment of a statistics textbook would be more likely to reveal the true nature of randomness, as a topic that is actually profoundly interesting.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I first read the book while in high school in Canada circa 1970.

The book descriptions are very accurate. The excellent and plausible story unfolds much as a Russian Easter egg. The dialogue is very clever.

This edition was issued by The Heritage Press, and contains a remarkable introduction by Theodore Dreiser. The introduction is something which I have re-read many times. As a beginning, Dreiser recounts his interaction with an intelligent American engineer, aged about 40, who was looking for a book \"with some meat to it.\" After long hesitation, and after compiling a list of some dozen books, Dreiser finally decided to recommend \"The Way of All Flesh.\"Six months later, he met the engineer by chance while strolling along a street in San Francisco, and the engineer immediately started praising the novel. \"Now there is a book which is honest! I can't think of another book from its time which contains more honesty, and more direct dealing!\"And indeed, this may be the main thing working in favor of \"The Way of All Flesh.\" Samuel Butler read Darwin, and became a believer in the theory of evolution. He was a penetrating observer of the cruelties of Victorian society, and of its hypocrisies. Few people will read this book without being able to remember this startlingly honest portrayal of a man who has just lost his wife, whom he did not love in the slightest:\"Theobald buried his face in his hands to conceal his want of emotion.\"Oh, touche!But other themes are extremely interesting: the idea of taking up a Christian vocation and going into the slums to dedicate your life to serving the poor -- it might work, but it might be a dreadful idea if you don't know what you're doing.And how about the narrator's bald statement:\"I know of no better thing for a young man than an independent income.\" (!!) That sentiment is not going to sit well with the people who believe that only a lifetime of wage-slavery is worth living! But Samuel Butler spoke from experience: when he was in his twenties, he escaped to New Zealand and took up sheep-farming, of all things. But... he did WELL as a sheep-farmer, sold out five years later at a very nice profit, and cleared eight thousand pounds. He invested it at ten percent and therefore had an independent income of eight hundred pounds per year. He returned to London, rented an apartment, and devoted the rest of his life to his intellectual life: writing, painting, and music. He is well-known as the author of \"Erewhon,\" as well as \"The Way of All Flesh.\"You should really take a look at this book. In some ways, it has shaped my life, in ways that sometimes surprise me. There's a lot of good, honest meat in this book -- and that's probably why it has been continuously in print for over a century, despite the fact that the academics pass over it in silence.Extremely high recommendation!","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"As an avid reader of history, I found this to be a very good start for Mr. Patton.

I grew up reading these books time and again, and each journey into this imaginary land is as fresh and exciting as the first journey there.\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" is a very simple fairy story at first glance: four children who have been squired to the English countryside to escape the London bombings during WWII find an entrance into a magical world through a wardrobe door. Yet underneath the surface, much is at work, as Lewis weaves myths and faith into a spellbinding adventure. When Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy enter Narnia, it is under the spell of the evil White Witch who can only be defeated when Aslan returns and the prophecy (which involves them) is fulfilled.For those only familiar with the writings that C.S. Lewis has done on religion and Christian apologetics, the notion of him writing a children's book must seem strange. Yet Lewis' first love was the myths and fairy stories that he devoured as a child, and Narnia is full of those creatures that sprang to life in his dreams. Lewis and his friend J.R.R. Tolkien were once under the impression that if they wanted to read the sort of stories that they liked, they would have to be the ones to write them.

It begins a thousand-year project that, through the cleaver acions of the protagonists, attempts to save humanity from a prolonged and chaotic interstellar Dark Age that was bound to follow the collapse of the Galactic Empire. Through the use of a mathematical application on history(as well as psychology and sociology) called Pschohistory, the founder of that field of study (Hari Seldon) developed a plan to truncate the Dark Age period from 10,000 years to 1,000 years.He begins this plan by setting up a colony on a planet at the rim of the galaxy called Terminus called the Foundation. From then on the inhabitants and their descendants of Terminus choose certain actions and follow certain policies that do not always make sense to the reader until or to other characters. Sometimes the Foudation seems to be self-desctructing or that the leaders are being treacherous. But not is all that it seems. Every once in a while, sometimes after 50 years, or 30 years, the Foudation is in a situation that either spells destruction or conquest by a neighboring kingdom. This is referred to as a Seldon Crisis. This is usually a turning point in the Foudation's path of history that was calcutaed by Seldon and part of his plan to bring about the New Galactic Empire after the fall of the old one. The important part is that Seldon Crises or the events thta bring them about are done through clever acts of political, economic or diplomatic manipulation. (Even psychological) What is most important to the plan is that Seldon needed the Foundation to be unaware of the path the people of Terminus must take. Thus, there are few social and psychological scholars to notice the trends and provide warning. THis way the actions taken are contolled for the sake of executing the Seldon plan.I did enjoy the book and will be reading and reportin on the sequels in the future. I thought it was cleaver and insightful on human nature as wellas a good understaning of history without hitting me over the head with it. The collapse of the Galactic Empire, which stretches into the sequels, is a clear reference to the long (relatively) fall of fthe Roman Empire. It seems that just like the Romans, the Galactic Empire will not be comquerds in on campaign liike Alexander did to Persia, but instead eveolve into another form of civilation with competeing factions comparable to the Catholic Church, the absolute (so-called) ruling kings, the nobles, the equestrians, and the outside threats such as muslim caliphs. The book was originally published in 1951 AD so it did not anticpate specifc technologies and the referce to nuclear power as \"atomics\" is a bit outdated. I would have hoped for nuclear fusion or the equivalent of such an epic transfornmation. Also, a bigger role for women characters other than the harpie wife of a foriegn aggressor in the book would have been nice. Maybe because I was reading Steig Larsson and some Star Wars novels recently I had gotten used to female protagonsts and antagonists. But FOUNDATION was written long ago and the audience for this genre was and may still be male dominated. There are sequels and prequels to for me to explore and for Asimov to redeem himself. JK.

For the first time, Wilde's original manuscript submitted for publication has been printed as he wrote and intended it, before other people's prejudices and pressure caused him to alter the text. This is a beautifully produced large format book, beautiful cover with Caravaggio's \"Narcissus\" cropped and darkened, detailed introduction, bibliography and analysis of the complete publishing history of this unusually tortured author and book. All variants are included in the notes and annotations. Of particular interest is the fact that it is this text, which has not previously been published, that Sir Edward Carson, Counsel for the brutal and sociopathic Marquis of Queensbury whom Wilde absurdly sued for libel over an open note in a men's club in which Queensbury, father of Wilde's infamous lover Bosie Douglas, wrote \"Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite (sic).\" But for Wilde's utterly mad legal action against Queensbury, he would not have faced the tremendous wealth of testimony and written evidence placed before the civil court by Carson, and would not have been prosecuted for any crimes, as he was after losing his libel action. Many of the passages which appear only in this new edition of \"The Picture\" were used by Carson to paint Wilde into a corner of criminality; and it is interesting to see just which sentences and paragraphs were accumulated to impeach Wilde on cross-examination. All in all, this is a wonderful book, almost too grand for its subject matter.

In one sense, it's a romance, in another, a perservation of the Appalachian history, or a coming-of-age story, a tribute to teachers, an exploration of the human spirit, a biography of the author's mother, a social commentary, and a profound testimony of faith. Christy is all these things separately, and together, infinitely more. Innocence and darkness intermingle. If you thought The Sound of Music, with its seven singing children and oncoming of the Nazi Party, was a bold contrast, Christy is a real study of good and evil, and the distinction is not always clear. The Appalachian lifestyle of the time is idealized at the same time it is met with harsh realism. The virtues and faults of each character present a vibrant cast of characters with real depth, which is one of the reasons you will find the book deeply moving. Christy especially is a heroine to grow up to - determined and nervous and challenging all at once. Her plights as a schoolteacher are often hilarious, and the children receive uncommon time in the spotlight, making the book all the more believable.

However, you may come to very different conclusions, or none at all, if you cannot put the clues in the context that Gardner does when Mason solves the crime.Here we start out with a very complicated set of situations, as Mason is approached by a man whose wife ran off with another man. But this isn't the first story Mason gets, as the client first complains about a howling dog next door. We soon discover that the dog may have had a good \"dog reason\" for his howling, but if that is so, then why did it abruptly stop? Then Mason's client disappears. Things only get more complicated from there to the very end.The TV show version of this book changed a few things around, but overall was remarkably close to the plot of the novel, which I always find to be entertaining.

We contend that the Confederates bled themselves nearly to death in the first three years of the war by making costly attacks more often than did the Federals.\"One theme of the book is that warfare had been changed by the outset of the Civil War, with the development of rifled guns. Masses of troops firing at one another at close range made some sense with the inaccurate muskets of the Revolutionary War or the Napoleonic Wars. However, such formations made much less sense as rifles increased accuracy and range.Among specific arguments that the book makes is that the romance of the bayonet was pretty much done; evidence suggests that rather few casualties came from bayonet thrusts? Why not? It was difficult for attacking soldiers to get close enough to defenders because of the rifle fire and the use of defensive positioning. Fieldworks thwarted many massed charges; soldiers on the defensive were ordinarily better placed for victory than those who attacked. Just so, the value of cavalry with sabers bared, charging. The bulk of cavalry combat came with troopers fighting as infantry did, not fighting from atop their horses.Doctrine lagged behind facts-on-the-ground. Only a few officers began to redefine how to carry out an offensive against entrenchments (e.g., Emory Upton). And, according to the authors, Confederates appeared less willing to give up the tactical offensive. Why? Here comes the rather bizarre part of the book. The authors content that southerners were more Celtic and Northern troops more English. And, the contention goes, Celtic warriors fought on the offensive (there is even an effort to tie the Rebel yell to Celtic warriors). At this point, the argument, to me, falls to pieces.Nonetheless, up to that point, the analysis makes some sense. Other books have explored this thesis, too, but--until the end--this book compares well.","sentiment_score":0.6},{"review":"I bought this book as part of a homeschool package for my daughter when she was 4 years old.

I will not praise Belo, save to say that I hope that he is eventually canonized. I will just say one thing. This book reveals such a consistent record of perfidy, stupidity, and cupidity on the part of the United States government as to make even the most patriotic man or woman ashamed of being an American. As readers of some of my other reviews will know, I am fairly Conservative Republican. Reading of Fords, Reagans , and Bushes short-sightedness and incompetence in the matter of Timor saddened and enraged me.The only ( slight)point in their favor is that the Democratic Presidents, Carter, and Clinton, were just as bad; Carter through simple incompetence, and Clinton through cowardice and greed. Let it be asaid and said plainly: The Clinton campaign became so dependent on the Riady families money that they turned blind eye to the atroicities occuring in Timor. With the laudable exception of a few republican members of congress such as Malcolm Wallop and Frank Wolf, practically no American public figure-Republican, democrat, or independent- has spoke out on the horrors occuring in Timor. Now, when it may well be too late, the world has begun to wake up.It is time for all men and women of good will, of all political and religous faiths, to cry out &quot;Enough&quot;. We cannot be so dependent on the raw materials and sweat shop produced sneakers and toys emanating from Indonesia that we would let theese horrors continue. I am going to phone and write every member of congress I know, asking them that they vote to discontinue ALL foriegn aid to Indonesia. I will also openly ask ALL presidential candidates- Republican, Democratic, and independent,if they will continue to support our bankrupt policy toward this outlaw state, Indonesia.

Not only was Arthur Conan Doyle a superb writer, with 2 very well-known characters still very much 'alive' after 100 years, but it's difficult to set up the scene for a murder that takes place so long ago, and in such a very different world than the one we live in today. Since I've read Carr's other books and was more than pleased with them, I knew what I was getting into here as far as concerned Carr's ability to continue setting up the dark Victorian Age with gaslights and railroads, too much coal usage leading to pollution that made much of England and Scotland very grimy, and similar to the pictures of Pittsburgh at that time and for the same reasons. The Industrial Age is not one I would choose to go back and visit.Anyone with any background in British history knows that Mary, Queen of Scots, went too far with her scheming and this led to her literally losing her head. But first, she bore a child, and watched most of her court go to early deaths because of her scheming, even if they weren't involved. One of these people was her secretary, Rizzio, a man from Italy, who just managed to be the wrong person for the wrong princess, in the wrong place at the wrong time. His death was gory and unnecessary, but it provides a nice backdrop for Carr to build a Holmesian novel on.A couple of very strange murders, that could not possibly have happened without supernatural powers do happen in one of the darker castles in Scotland, Holyrood. The bodies of the two men who are murdered are left in such a forensic state, that many doubt they could have been done by the hands of man (except of course, Mycroft and Sherlock Holmes who are baiting each other as usual concerning the intelligence levels of each other). Both the brothers are suspicious from the start that these murders were purposely made to look like they are supernatural with the hopes they won't be looked at too closely. And when the murderers learn the two brothers and Watson are involved, they know their time is limited if they want to succeed with what they are trying to do...This was one of the more enjoyable mysteries I've read in a long time. I've been waiting for Carr to put out another one. The price we pay for a decent historical mystery, especially one involving such famous characters means readers have to wait for the authors to do significant amounts of research and writing to get their books to the quality that we want them to be. This book succeeded very well in my opinion.Karen SAdler","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I bought this book when it first came out, which means that I have had the hardcover somewhere in the to-read pile for about two years. I don't know what took me so long to read it. Jonathan Franzen treats us to an unforgiving and dark exploration of the nature of early 21st century America in this sharp and witty novel. The Corrections focuses on an average American family -- average in that though they're somewhat unconventional yet have hopes, dreams, flaws and foibles like the rest of us. The Lamberts are kind of a mess. Alfred, the family patriarch, suffers from Parkinson's, and his wife, Enid, is in denial about the nature of his suffering, as well as many other details about her family. She is trying desperately to have &quot;one last Christmas&quot; at the family home in the Midwest, trying to convince her three grown children to leave the east coast where they now live to let her have this one dream. Good luck Enid with getting them all together! Her youngest, Denise is the only one who agrees to come. Denise perhaps has to escape the mess she has made of her life in Philadelphia. Chip, the middle child, has left New York, after being fired from his cushy academic position for sexual harassment, and is somewhere in Eastern Europe perpetrating securities fraud on an unsuspecting American public. And Gary... well, Gary's wife doesn't see the point of dragging their three boys out there because she cannot get along with her mother-in-law...Franzen explores this family through various viewpoints. We witness their struggles, despair and happiness with a witty and ironic narration that makes The Corrections a terrific read. The Corrections is a big, long, enjoyable novel that maybe could have used some editing, for the author does over explain things at times. But having over explained some things doesn't make Jonathan Franzen any less gifted. He has a unique writing style that captures the reader from its first page. It's funny in the dark, dry, sarcastic way that I love in this sort of novel. I've no idea why it took me so long to give this great novel a whirl. I am glad I did. I cannot recommend The Corrections enough.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This collection of Cobb's essays is another book in the NYRB series which I did not want to finish reading. These essays are about more than Paris or Normandy or even Europe; here is a record left by an Englishman who passionately loved a place, a bi-cultural historian and writer who grew his soul between the rare archived records of France and the living streets he loved.Richard Cobb has shown me that writing a memoir of place is a sensory experience. His essays are so rich in textured intimacy that I feel \"le Cobb\" is living still. One can find him strolling down an avenue observing every alteration of the weather, every change in the pavement, in the passersby, their clothing and language. I imagine Cobb still sitting in his favorite haunt, the late night and early morning caf?, sipping the 4:00 a.m. calvados, or apple brandy, as he watches the barges come up the river. From his youth, to his late travels, Cobb had found that one cannot write history without knowing the living. Le Cobb called himself a \"prisoner of habit\" (301), and this, I believe, is the key to the depth of detail in his writing. He frequented the same places, the same towns, kept in touch with the same French and Belgian friends. But there is also something exquisitely lonely about Cobb, the solitary observer, that appeals to the wounded romantic in every traveler.I'm concerned that the general reader will not pick up this book; the density of language in Paris and Elsewhere appears to be for the intimate specialist only. But the essays are about desire for a place, about human interaction in that space, how people create each other's lives, and the anger and grief one feels when a beloved city or village is altered forever--phenomena and feelings which anyone can apply to anyplace in the world. I highly recommend this book for people involved in city planning, the New Urbanists, any reader wondering why the French no longer wear berets, or any reader looking for a context or background as to how or why the recent riots and rebellions occurred across France in the past year.Cobb loved France enough to criticize the French particularly in the decades from the Baron Haussman in the mid 19th-century to Georges Pompidou in the 1970s when so much destruction was visited upon Paris in the name of `architecture.' Cobb shows that Brussels and Paris sustained more damage after World War II than before: \"The damage which has been inflicted on these two cities is not, then, the result of enemy--or Allied--action\" (200). In Paris distinctive neighborhoods were destroyed by the French themselves with no concern for how people's lives were being altered or the monoculture being created. Well, Monsieur Cobb, this vandalism to intimate dwellings, social settings, tiny restaurants, private gardens, the homes and boulevards of experience, is now a global condition. Thank you so much, Professor Cobb, for such beautiful writing on such a bittersweet topic.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"The second chapter (sermon) in this book alone is work the price of the book.

Lord Damien Montjoy, one of Richard's faithful knights who would help the king take Jerusalem, and lord of his own castle back in England, is rewarded by Richard for his valor with the adjoining lands of Lady Katherine (\"Kat\") de Montrain--and with the hand of the lady herself. Richard also wants Montjoy there as he needs to secure the north of England from the wiles of his brother John. Ah, but there are legends about the forest there...Robin Hood, LIttle John, Friar Tuck, Lady Greensleeves and the Silver Sword! Prince John would give Kat's hand to the evil de la Ville who will pay him richly as John is ever in need of funds. The Silver Sword, who once saved her father's life, arrives to save her from de la Ville and deliver her to Montjoy, but then the Sword takes her innocence (the way I read it, it's actually a rape, force after a strong \"no!\" though there is then some mutual passion involved). Kat is a strong and beautiful young woman...in fact, the Lady Greensleeves herself! She goes on to wed Montjoy, her nemesis from her youth, because he is King Richard's choice and she has few other options. She hates them all! Could she ever love such a man? (\"Never!\") Does she love the Silver Sword after their night of intimacy? (\"No!\") But all will come right and the legends will have their day.

Book one was actually quite good, I was entranced the whole time I was reading it, the story appears to be quite simple and the obvious is suddenly questioned, the suspect count rises and the real murderer slithers unnoticed, that is until the little Belgian super hero, Hercule Poirot gets involved. Invited by his friend Hastings, he's joined at the great mansion at the Styles Court where Emily Inglethorp runs the house, along with her new husband and her friends and relatives she lives of the riches her deceased husband has left her. On what seems a random evening she suffers horribly and ends up dead, with her current will in question and some strange things happening between the quests and the family members, there is sudden distrust of some of the members, but those who seem guilty and those are actually guilty are two different things, it's up to Poirot to stretch his little legs and big brain and get to the bottom of things. There is greed and jealousy and hidden feelings that surface only to explode in everyone's face, the fun has began!The book was a lot of fun, not only is it a fast and captivating read, it makes the reader think quite a bit. I took my time reading it and loosely going over the clues in my head. Upon reading the ending I was off in my decision of the guilty suspect but never the less I loved the ending and the final explanation, some clues might not be as crystal clear as others but there are many of them; reading is fun when the field is wide, not when it's thin and obstructed by lack of ideas and this novel certainly had me guessing all over the place. Agatha Christie is one of my favorite authors because every time I read her books I feel a jolt of joy, I get so much out of them and nothing written in these days will ever compare, so to me they are relics from the past that shine even brighter than many brand new books written these days. The mystery is fun but the whole feel of this book is even better, the old fashioned ideas and culture adds something whimsical to all of her works. Every time I pick up a Hercule Poirot novel I know I will have a nice time, so far I haven't been disappointed as I have read them half my life and will continue to do so. Currently I had to start book number two in the series, I am on such a happy high from the first one that my thirst for mystery hasn't been quenched yet, so I'm off to read \"Murder on the links\" and see where the adventure takes me, from what I head it's Paris and the crime is quite good..- Kasia S.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"For those of you familiar with my writing, you know I cherish the works of Marlowe, Shakespeare, Milton, Hawthorne, and Dickens. Well, I now have a 6th favorite. Lodovico is frighteningly demonic. 1st he participates in the murder of Isabella, then he participates in the revenge of Isabella! Poor Isabella is memorable as a picture of innocence. Vittoria is an interesting woman. She is not exactly a picture of innocence, but she does carry herself well, and she faces her death with as much dignity as possible. Webster also draws the dissension between Francisco and Bracciano well. Bracciano is captivating with all of his ambition. Francisco is memorable as the good and decent man prompted to fury by the death of his innocent sister. The harsh tones between Cornelia and her son Flamineo are dramatic. Bracciano's son Giovanni is well drawn. First he is an innocent young man, but his lines reveal his good character. Then we see him after he has lost both his parents. Finally, he flips the tables on everyone and restores order. Cardinal Monticelso is also captivating. He is a very careful character who probes the situations without losing his sense of reason. And we need not be surprised when this careful character is promoted to Pope Paul IV. What's left? Only striking images, only well constructed passages, only pure terror side by side with beauty etc. My only complaint about this play is that Webster combines 2 wonderful final touches that would be wonderful by themselves, but do not combine well (in my opinion). Lodovico's delight in his massacre does not (in my opinion) mix well with Giovanni's sudden rise to power and his sudden crush of the situation. In my opinion what makes Edward III's restoration to order in Marlowe's &quot;Edward II&quot; so dramatic is the pure terror the 17 year old king instills in his enemies.

I had watched Interview With the Vampire about ten times and thought to myself, hey, why don't I read the books, since they're usually even better, plus you can see where these characters end up going. I've read horror novels every since I was younger, Stephen King, Richard Laymon, Bentley Little, Clive Barker and this seemed a logical step in my never ending search for good authors to read. And a bonus was that these would be higher class horror, since these books really aren't focused on the horror bits, but more on the characters and where they fit and they live in breath in a world of mortals. It's all quite fascintating really, and Anne Rice pulls it off with beautiful prose and terrific stories. The first four or so books in the series were superb, and then quite suddenly the quality started to slowly detiorate. I still enjoyed the novels, but not as much. They seemd to be lacking what those original four had and this continued up until her last book in the series, Merrik. Luckily, with Blood and Gold, a story about one of my favorite side character vampires, Marius, Anne Rice is close to reaching the greatness of those four original novels again. She's not quite there mind you, but close, and I can't wait to read Blackwood Farm and BLood Canticle after this.This story follows Marius as he explains to an old Northern Warrior Vampire, Thorne, about his life story. He starts in some time after he's been created and we follow Marius's story as it weaves through Rome and Italy into the snowy Alps and into present time with the Vampire Lestat, all while he keeps Those Who Must Be Kept safe, which I'm really glad make a return to the series because I really liked the mystery of the King and Queen. The story lets Marius look upon his life where he believes he did a lot of lying to himself and the people around him. Pandora, his lost love after he left her when they argued and then destroyed a band of Satanist Vampires, who Marius searched for for centuries after realizing his folley. Mael whom had a hand in Marius's inception into the blood and whom Marius still hates to this very day. Santino, the evil leader of the Satanist Vampires. Bianca and Amedeo who Marius becomes close to as mortals during his painting years, only to make them into vampires of his own ilk later down the line.There's plenty of trajedy in the story and arguing as Marius tries to keep the secret of Those Who Must Be Kept from the other Vampires, especially the Satanists. It's fascinating to watch Marius latch on to different mortals for different reasons, whether it be because they are a great painter or a beautiful woman who is poisining on a semi-regular basis her party guests. Marius has always been one of my favorite side characters and I had always hoped he'd get a book unto himself like Armad and Pandora did. But that's one of the problems with this book, probably its biggest problem. When you read this story, assuming you've read Pandora, The Vampire Armand and Queen of the Dammed, you're basically rereading a lot of those stories once again in this book. Sure its through the eyes of Marius now and what he thinks, which isn't to enlightning, but its still basically a rehash of those stories. The entire book isn't like that, but there are large sections where you say to yourself, \"Hey, I already know all of this.\" That's probably my only major complaint with the book, that and it's seemingly tacked on bookends of a beginning and an end. The rest of the story is a well written fascinating look into Marius's life and a welcome return for Rice towards the granduer of her beginning Vampire books.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Good read, worth the time.

Her latest novel Persuasion continues the theme of society, love, and marriage and how money and jealousy interferes. Published posthumously, Persuasion is a dramatic story about persuading others of love, adhering to wishes of family and society, and the subtle hints that foretell every climatic chapter.Widower Sir Walter Elliot lives on his Kellynch-hall estate with his two daughters Elizabeth and Anne. Both girls had unsuccessful chances at marriage: Elizabeth was turned down by Mr. Elliot, a family cousin and heir to Sir Walter's estate who married a plain woman of fortune instead; Anne had a great affair with a Mr. (now Captain) Wentworth, a naval officer who had nothing--and was therefore ineligible--to marry Anne. As Sir Walter falls deeper into debt, the Elliot family leases the estate to an Admiral Croft in order to save money. And Admiral Croft, naturally, is a great friend of Captain Wentworth, who reappears eight years after he and Anne parted. Can Anne persuade Captain Wentworth to lover her once again? The answer lies in the story.Like in her other novels, Jane Austen incorporates the manners and social customs of the early 1800s in her novels. The novel speaks of the \"great war\" with Napoleon that the British Navy fought, and the characters are forever thinking about money and royal connections. Anne very much wanted to marry Captain Wentworth when the first fell in love. But English custom demands that a couple gets approval of their marriage from the bride's family. And as Captain Wentworth was poor at the time, the Elliots strictly forbade Anne from marrying him, and she didn't. Throughout the novel the characters also maintain an air of sophistication and elegance--an air required of everyone in the British court. And as Sir Walter Elliot was known in court, the whole family had to behave with \"utmost decorum.\"\"It was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again.\" (Austen 197).Foreshadow is prominent in the novel. In Chapter 2 both Captain Wentworth and Mr. Elliot are mentioned, assuring the reader that they will be prominent main characters. It was not until the end that the characters discover the reason behind Mr. Elliot's first marriage, but one character hinds that \"money, money was all that he wanted\" (Austen 178). After page 17 it becomes obvious to the reader what would happen between Anne and Captain Wentworth, for \"repeating his name so often...was a new sort of trial on Anne's nerves\" (Austen 44). Little hints along the way suck the reader deeper and deeper into the story.Although \"Proper English\" is intimidating when reading Jane Austen's stories, her plots are classics in love and marriage. Anyone who has gone through a painful break up or a dramatic relationship knows just how much money, family and jealously can ruin a relationship. Austen dramatically tells the stories of her heroines while maintaining a 19th century setting, and drops subtle hints along the way to keep readers hooked. Persuasion is a classic that is understood and loved by all who read it.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"This book is more than exciting fiction. It's a primer for most of the real world.

Veiled Sentiments is the book she wrote on the lives and poetry of Awlad Ali. Abu Lughod field work was clearly not carried out from a \"superior\" stance; she sympathized with her subjects and dealt with them as equal human beings rather than inferior specimen or cultures. Abu Lughod attitude, intelligence, training and tremendous analystical ability helped her in developing great insight and understanding of this fascinating culture.Abu Lughod analysis of concepts such as \"hishma\" was truly incisive and shed a great deal of light on the nature of modesty between women and men and amongst men and women. The analysis seems to explain behaviors and norms witnessed elsewhere in Egypt and indeed other parts of the Middle East.An important thesis of Abu Lughod is that the Awlad Ali people often communicated in very conservative and modest way directly through words; they only said what was proper and fitted the norms. Yet a second mode of communication far more true and expressive was found in their little songs or poems.Abu Lughod discussed gender relation amongst Awlad Ali at length and the relationship between women and the families of their husbands and the society at large. I really enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it. For an excellent work on veiling and gender issues, I would recommend Leila Ahmed's Women & Gender in Islam.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This is the best book that I have ever read!

Persuasion is the easiest book of Austen's to get into, to follow, and to love. She makes the characters real by explaining them in many situations. When I read this book, I instantly became friends with Anne Elliot, the family outcast, because she was an outcast. Then she became even more my friend when she became the beloved and desired friend and love of Captain Wentworth. I loved seeing Anne go through the difficulties of dealing with her past actions, and instead of wanting to go back and change the past, she wanted to go forward and decide the future. Austen masterfully portrays all of her characters, and I would love to go to Lyme and see where Anne met her cousin, and to Bath to see where she and Captain Wentworth decided their future together. Persuasion is my favorite book of Austen's, and if you read it, it will be yours, too.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I read this book with delight.

As \"Aria of the Sea\" discussed the issues of life choices, controlling relationships, and suicide, this companion novel brings to light the struggles faced by those with Bi-Polar II Disorder. Phoenix is a very strong, kind-hearted, and realistic heroine who must make important decisions regarding her own health at the same time that she is trying to figure out how to save the princesses. This novel contains the beautiful seaside imagery and some of the characters we remember from \"Aria of the Sea,\" though readers won't have to have read that one first. Phoenix's story is full of magic and truth, the fantastic and realistic elements woven together to create an engaging fantasy novel with an important lesson. Calhoun's novels, though they highlight specific issues, have very widespread messages. The decisions Phoenix must make could inspire others who've come to a point where they must either choose to help themselves or risk losing themselves completely, even if their probems are very different from those of the main character. I recommend this novel both as a huge fan of teen fantasy novels and as a future teacher certified to teach English and Pyschology.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I read it every year.

The book is written in great detail, with memories that are both touching and entertaining.The Watsukis were one of the first families to arrive at Manzanar, after being forced to leave their fishing business on the coast of California. Jeanne Watsuki was a member of the Watsuki family, and suffered and grew up in Manzanar.She included memories about the recruitment of Japanese-Americans for the war, the racism against the Japanese, and the aftermath, when the Americans finally realized that the Japanese in America should have the same rights as everyone else. Though the camp was to hold the Japanese in a kind of prison, Jeanne Watsuki has good memories as well as bad.Jeanne Watsuki Houston and James D. Houston did a very good job of describing the Watsukis' experiences. They included a lot of details-including a timeline and a list of Japanese terms used in the book-that were helpful in understanding the story as well as making it enjoyable. The memoir itself was not a thrilling adventure tale, but one of a life tainted by captivity.I do recommend this book, especially if you are interested in World War II. As well as being highly informative about the Japanese during the war, it tells you about the life in an internment camp as a memoir, with accurate details that deeply help your understanding of the book. It is a great read for someone looking for an interesting book, or even for someone looking for an informative book that tells about the Japanese internment camps.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Dr. Susan Heitler understands depression and matters of the mind in a scholarly way.

Now divorced, she's finding success running her own art gallery in a small town. Only Nick seems to be back in her life, and when he takes one look at three year-old Jonathan he sees that there can be no doubt that the child is his son, something he had not believed for one second years before. He wants his son. Knowing Abby's loyal heart, he threatens to financially ruin her friends and community, unless she remarry him. Abby knows that Nick needs an heir as his grandfather is ailing and instead of turning control of the family empire rightfully to Nick, he would turn it over to Nick's sister and her children. So she agrees to the marriage making it clear that when the old man dies, she will be free to take her son and move on. Nick spells it out clearly that their marriage, however long it is, will be a full and normal one.Ms. Baird grabs your attention and quickly your heart right from the beginning pages. This is a very powerful story of a deep love that should never have been broken. Nick's behaviour to Abby is quite ruthless, but we get very real glimpses of the immense pain he feels. Abby is a woman to admire, and through her reflections of their fairytale marriage and it's sudden demise, we can see how strong Abby has become. Both are incredibly passionate people who feel so deeply, yet allow their pride to keep those deep feelings from the other. Nick's regret and guilt for the years before, and Abby's fear that she will this time not be able to survive, make this a very intense and powerful story. Bravo to Ms. Baird!

That is no small feat for a book to accomplish. To speak to people the world over, for over 50 years, means that there is something very universal in this text.We are all the mockingbirds of the title, and anyone who has reached the age of majority knows the feelings that the loss of innocence, and the harsh light of reality can create in a person. Harper Lee wrote a novel that captured the essence of that most universal of experiences, and I for one am moved by it every time.I won't rehash plot points, but I will give you some reasons why you should read, and then reread, this text.The first reason is for the beautiful depiction of imaginative childhood. The narrator, her brother Jem, and their friend Dill embody most of the traits of childhood, and their creative games, and thought processes are a joy to behold. The voice of Scout (the narrator) is a pitch perfect recreation of childhood and childish impulses.Another reason is a pretty simple one actually. The character of Atticus Finch is one of the noblest literary creations ever written. I want to be like him, and there are not many characters in literature I can, or would, say that about. The fact that being like Atticus is possible makes him even more endearing to me. He is someone who is noble in every sense of the word, and serves as an inspiration for so many reasons. He is a good father, a decent and empathetic man, and a person who tries to see the good in almost anything. The fact that there are so few Atticus Finches in real life makes him seem all the more desirable to me. It is very obvious as you read this text that Ms. Lee loves this character.There are numerous other reasons why this is a stellar work of genius, not least of which is the wonderful plotting of the novel, the excellent and fleshed out supporting characters (these people are real to me) and the message that Lee find numerous ways to reiterate throughout the book.Ms. Lee has created a pastoral version of the Depression era south, and even though there is vicious bigotry and hatred depicted in the novel, Ms. Lee (through her characters) does not give up on them, or us. We and the world can be better. We just need to remind ourselves to walk in other people's shoes once in a while.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I recently purchased this book, and I am very impressed.

And, as one would expect, it is an ideal text to be read in conjunction with Audi's book. Almost all the subjects discussed in that book--the exceptions being moral and religious knowledge--are given corresponding sections in this anthology. Nevertheless, I see no reason why this book needs to be used in conjunction with the other book. It is a perfectly fine selection of readings for a person who wants a picture of some of the main areas of debate in epistemology. For those who may be coming to the book without the background provided by reading Audi's introductory text, Huemer provides a short introduction to the subject matter of each chapter. And it seems he has chosen historical selections that help the reader to understand the nature of the problems being discussed in each of the sections and why someone might think those problems are important ones.A signal virtue of this book is that it is helpful in introducing both contemporary and historical work in epistemology. Is it somewhat paradoxical that almost half of a volume in a series called Routledge Contemporary Readings in Philosophy should consist of historical papers? Somewhat so, perhaps, but it isn't all that surprising in a philosophy text. For, as any student of philosophy can tell you, the history of philosophy isn't just history; it's also crucial for understanding the nature of the problems with which philosophers are dealing and the possible solutions that can be offered in response to those problems. And this volume is quite good at introducing the history of philosophical thought about the nature, structure, and varieties of human knowledge. Its coverage of the history of the subject in modern philosophy is especially good, as it includes several selections from Hume and from Reid, along with selections from Locke, Berkeley, Kant. It also provides the reader with a introduction to the history of epistemological thought in the twentieth century, as it includes work by important figures from the earlier part of the century--Russell, Moore, and Ayer--and work by important mid-century figures, like Quine, Austin, and Goodman. Huemer also throws in a few selections from the ancients.Though this volume is not edited by the author of the Routledge Contemporary Introductions to Philosophy, it is intended as a companion volume to that book. It takes its form Audi's introduction, in that it shifts the usual focus in introducing epistemology to the beginning student of the subject. Instead of beginning with skeptical challenges and with general issues about the nature and structure of knowledge, this volume, like Audi's introduction, begins by focusing on more particular forms of knowledge and the ways in which we can acquire them. Huemer has included sections on each of the following types of knowledge: knowledge acquired through perception, through memory, through the testimony of others, through reason (i.e. and a priori knowledge), and through inductive inferences. Most of the historical material is in these sections of the anthology--but all of these sections include at least a couple papers by contemporary figures as well.The latter half of the volume concerns the general issues about the nature and structure of knowledge on which contemporary epistemologists tend to focus their research. Here the discussion is on the usual topics: foundationalism vs. coherentism, skepticism, the analysis of knowledge. These sections tend to include more readings than the sections discussed above, and thus, even though only half the anthology is concerned with these general issues, it still provides an excellent introduction to them. The reader should note that there isn't any separate section on internalist vs. externalist accounts of knowledge, though this topic comes up in both the section on skepticism and the section on the analysis of knowledge.This is a very good anthology, and it's especially good for the price. It covers quite a bit of material, and it covers it quite well. The only possible problem one might have with this anthology is that its coverage of contemporary epistemology isn't as extensive as it might have been. But, importantly, it is intended as an introduction to work in both contemporary and historical epistemology rather than as an exhaustive survey of the subject. (For a more in-depth anthology in contemporary epistemology, check out the Epistemology volume edited by Sosa and Kim and published in Blackwell's Philosophy Anthologies series.)I'd recommend this anthology for classes aimed at undergraduate students and for anyone with some philosophical background who's interested in epistemology.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"All I can say is these books are excellent.

For Hofstadter, populists suffered from irrational status anxiety in a changing world; Populism was unjustified extremism. For Goodwyn, the agrarian movement was entirely rational having identified several financial structures and practices as leading to unfair outcomes for farmers.Barnes is definitely in the Goodwyn camp. But whereas Goodwyn attempted a wholesale coverage of Populism, Barnes confines herself mostly to the Texas Alliance and the Populist Party in Texas. The closer examination of the cooperative methods used by the Alliance is a useful extension of Goodwyn's work.The author, like Goodwyn, is concerned with the basis and nature of protest movements. Protest movements are examined under the categories of a structural strain perspective and a mobilization perspective. The first perspective is associated with the Hofstadter school. The author is especially concerned with debunking the idea that protest mobilizations that have any longstanding impact somehow \"just happen\" without formal organization.The book is a very analytical assessment of mobilization theory using the agrarian movement and Populism as the laboratory. It provides key refinements and correctives of earlier work. It is highly recommended for understanding the phenomenon of Populism.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"While I agree with the review that this book may not be true Science Fiction, but should be considered Fantasy, I still enjoyed this book.

I don't know where this fits in with other Westerfeld series, but it certainly seems to be worth a look on its own.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I highly recommend the Kaplan Literature review.

I can't be too sure of that since there are too many things mentioned to verify them all. On page 2 the author got my attention with this statement:\"For another, many geneticist believe that civilization causes the human stock slowly to degenerate, by enabling persons with unfavorable mutations to live and breed.\" I have often though that this is the case with the human race.On page 191 the author may have answered a question that I had wondered about for many years, since first learning about Hannibal using elephants to cross the Alps against the Romans and having been lead to understand that African elephants can not be domesticated. The author states that the Moroccan variety of the African elephant was exterminated by the Romans to be used in their games held in the coliseum.The author shows how engineering advanced through out history in many parts of the world but did not delve into the Americas and the amazing structures that these people built. The one thing that I found very interesting was about the invention of the printing press and how it was not just something that started with Gutenberg but had begun in China and Korea but because of their writing system it was difficult to refine. The printing press and books probably did more to advance civilization than any other invention of all time.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"The late Isaac Asimov is one of my all-time favorite sci-fi writers. He was one of the old \"hard sci-fi\" school that populated the `50s and a successful member of that community by the way.This story is the second step in the long friendship between the earthling New York detective Elijah Baley and the robot detective R. Daneel Olivaw. You don't need to read \"The Caves of Steel\" to understand this one, it is almost a stand alone book.Situated in a far future Earth, Humankind has divided into Spacers who dwell scattered in fifty worlds (and are the rich & advanced society) and Earthlings that remain in the Mother World, inhabiting overcrowded underground cities. Both groups distrust and despise each other.A murder occurred in Solaria an Outer World. Elijah is put in charge of the investigation due to his success in the previous investigation.Once again he will team with R. Daneel.Here different phobias interact conditioning the development of the events.Bailey is terrorized to be outside of he caves. From that fact derives the title of the novel as the Naked Sun is almost unbearable to stand for him.The Solarians avoid direct contact with other humans. They interact thru holographic system and are surrounded and served by robots that do not look like humans.Imagine in this context how a crime is possible. Well that is the task of our heroes.On this background Asimov, once again, construct a many layered novel. At one level is a classical detective's story at another one a study on alien cultures interacting. In yet another level is psychological approach to phobias.In a classical Asimovan way, each chapter introduces new elements and characters to the action until at last everything squares to a satisfactory ending.Both partners will continue their adventures and mystery solving in \"Robots of Dawn\". R. Daneel will resurface at the closing volumes of the \"Foundation\" saga.Enjoy one of Asimov's earlier works!Reviewed by Max Yofre.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I always thought this was the best work that Dr. Seuss put on paper.

The book itself is a metaphor to the communist regime in Russia. For example the pigs are the communist leaders, the dogs are the secret police, and the other animals are the peasants just trying to survive another day.I liked this book because of the author's ability to show the themes without much in-between the lines reading. Plus, the metaphors are obvious and exaggerated. For example, one of the themes in this book was that people can and will go to any means to seize and maintain power. Orwell shows, Napoleon, a pig resembling Stalin, takes new born puppies with him to the attic of the barn for several months where he gains their trust and teaches them that he is always good and Snowball, Napoleon's brother, is bad. Once Napoleon had trained the puppies he had them go out and exile Snowball, and when four pigs protested that Napoleon had no right to do that he quickly ordered his dogs to silence them. Once that had been taken care of some animals confessed to seeing Snowball in a dream, he put them to the same punishment as the four pigs. At some points the food in the farm was so scarce that Napoleon had the animals on quarter rations and himself on obesity rations, the reason he did this was to brag to other farmers how much better off his farm was than any human's.In my opinion this was a great book about how communism is another totalitarian government because people can and will go to any means to seize and maintain power. I give George Orwell a lot of credit for writing this book criticizing our former World War II allies at the time he did.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This was an enjoyable book to read--really interesting concept.

A search for the ship's lost treasure takes the diver\/adventurer from a Caribbean hurricane to a secret Russian base to a plot to assassinate Castro. Thrown into the mix is a secret base on the moon built by a clandestine group of government and business people that the Soviets are about to attack.A pretty good Pitt adventure. Lots of impossible escapes for Dirk. Jessie LeBaron made a good female interest for Pitt. She starts off as your typical stuck-up rich woman, but later shows she's not afraid to get her hands dirty and can endure a lot of suffering. And I LOVED their first scene together where Pitt puts her in her place. That was legend! I was dissapointed there wasn't as much interaction between Pitt and his best friend, Al Giordino, as in most Cussler novels. Really liked Ira Hagen, the President's man trying to get to the bottom of the moonbase conspiracy. Comes off as an average looking guy, but has a first-rate investigative mind and a tenacious attitude. Some good action scenes at the Russian base and with the battle on the moon, though I did question some of the technical accuracy, like people only coming away wounded when their spacesuit is ripped open.All in all, a good Dirk Pitt adventure.","sentiment_score":0.6},{"review":"As Gareth Stedman Jones notes in his excellent and extensive introduction, `The Communist Manifesto remains a classic because of it unsurpassed depiction of modern capitalism and the transforming power of industrialization.' The industrial process destabilized all hierarchies and subverted all sacred and secular inherited beliefs and practices. It turned everything everywhere into an object for sale.But, it also liberated people from backwardness and tradition-bound dependence.The Communist Manifesto splits the world in two hostile camps: the Bourgeoisie (the haves, the owners of the means of production) and the Proletariat (the have-nots).The Bourgeoisie tore asunder the feudal society. It left no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest (cash payments). It created one freedom: free trade.But the Bourgeoisie also created its nemesis, the Proletariat, a class of labourers who can live only so long as they find work and who can only find work if their labour increases capital (is profitable).In order to survive, all Proletarians should unite all over the world in order to conquer political power and to create a free society.This free society should be attained by the following measures: abolition of all private property, of the family nucleus, of all countries and nationalities, of all religions and moralities, of all rights of inheritance and of all child labour.All production instruments (industry, property, banking) should be centralized in the hands of the State (monopolies). There should be a heavy progressive income tax and free education for everyone.Of course, this manifesto is partly extremely utopian (contrarian to biological `gene' interests) and far too optimistic about the `proletarian' management of State monopolies.But its forceful message (ultimately, freedom for everyone) continues to send social, economic and political shockwaves all over the world.This book contains also all the published prefaces of the manifesto, as well as excellent notes and suggestions for further reading.This is probably the best, and certainly the most important, pamphlet ever written.A must read.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This book was great!!

This book tells you how.&quot; These words on the back cover caught my interest. That's a pretty tall promise, I thought. If anything, recent events have left me feeling like the whole world is out of control and will not be set right in my lifetime.Author Ervin Laszlo takes a look at major historic changes (like the Industrial Revolution) and comes to the conclusion that we are in middle of the next, brought on as industrial nation-states run smack into the challenges of globalization.In an eerie foreshadowing of current events he warns that the world is more diverse than we think, and that much of it feels left behind as the western nations consume the earth's goods at breakneck speed. &quot;Militant fundamentalism is an extreme expression of the resentment generated by these conditions,&quot; Laszlo says. And we have seen the results all to clearly.With change inevitable, he predicts that keepers of tradition will become more resistant, bringing on the kind of Doomsday Scenarios favored by Science Fiction writers and survivalist cults: instability, uncertainty, discontent, conflict and violence. Meanwhile, the environment will continue to be ravaged by the haves and have-nots alike.But Laszlo doesn't think the end of the world as we know it is inevitable. He really believes, and makes a good case for, the power of the individual. He uses reliable surveys to show that approximately 25% of the population in the United States and Western Europe espouse a holistic approach to life that really can turn the world around. The problem, he says, is they don't knew their own strength.Laszlo speaks (and the book often presents itself as if it were a classroom lecture) in the moralistic tone of turn-of-the twentieth century reformers. It's refreshing to hear someone from the western world speak up against the excesses of a market-driven economy and recommend that we help our neighbors, take up a physical activity or hobby, or read a book. His motto is &quot;think globally and act morally.&quot; Along the way he takes to task meat eaters, smokers, big business, fundamentalists, and organized labor while questioning patriotism, efficiency at any cost, and conspicuous consumption.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"About a year ago, my book group read, &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea,&quot; Jean Rhys' 'pre-quel' to &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot; In book group, we are frequently forced to give notice to the fact that a book varies with the age of the reader and that there are childhood books that belong to childhood while there are other books that grow with you throughout your life. With that in mind, I thought it would be fun to REread Jane Eyre. About half way through the book, I realized that I had never read it before: this was my first read! Interestingly, the woman who led the discussion on Wide Sargasso Sea had the identical experience. So did another. We decided that it was more than the movie in which the still only babyfat Orson Welles wished himself to be the romantic hero: Jane Eyre was so much a part of Western Culture that without actually having read the book, we knew it. Charlotte Bronte, writing at the very beginning of the 19th century, was a much better writer than many who followed her. George Sand's writing is more pretentious and more closely tied to the 18th century. While &quot;Little Women&quot; is a wonderful book to revisit, Louisa May Alcott's potboilers are tiresome. I can not get into Dickens or James Fenimore Cooper. Until you come upon writers who bridge the gap between the 19th and 20th centuries -- Edith Wharton springs to mind -- no one is quite as readable as Charlotte, unless it is one of her sisters.That is not to say that the plot holds up. It is riddled with co-incidence that nearly undermines Bronte's intentions. However, her characters live and have dimension, even if their circumstances do not. So often, the infamous &quot;canon&quot; is criticized as being full of dead white European males. Charlotte is a woman whose work has shaped our thoughts and influenced us for nearly 200 years. I would say that Charlotte Bronte is part of the Western canon.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"When my mom bought me this book, I wasn't excited to read it.

It was worth it.Boswell, to my knowledge, seems to be the first biographer in the modern sense of the word. He tries to give a rounded picture of his subject and also a structured account, structured by time but also structured by focusing on the body, the mind and the sould, usually in that order. What a time to have lived in London, to meet Johnson, Adam Smith, Burke, Gibbon. Johnson emerges as the central sun around which all other planets circle. This also makes for one of the weaknesses of this autobiography, that Johnson crowds out all around him. Yes, a biography should put the subject in the center, but not exclusively so. Boswell also neglects to explain the historical context. Like so many writers on contemporary history he assumes his subjects to be of such universal importance as to make them also common knowldge 300 years after publication. Clearly it is not so, and Boswell could have been helpful by putting more of what he is writing into context rather than leaving it to the footnotes of future editors.Delightful rather than annoying are his fights especially with Ms. Thrale about who might be the superior biographer. In 18th century style he does not shy away in calling the competing biographer names and casting doubt on her motives and moral rectitude.All in all a fascinating document, though for modern readers often tedious and only recommended for 'hardcore' readers.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I have read this book many times, and enjoyed it more each time that I did.

Tolkien's dark, war-ravaged epic fantasy Lord of the Rings would have sprung from such an innocent, light-hearted adventure?When a peace-loving Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins has his humble home visited by the legendary wizard Gandalf the Grey and an entourage of 13 dwarves, Bilbo finds himself embarking on a quest that will take him all across the great lands of Middle Earth, meeting a host of characters and creatures both friendly and not, and stumbling across great treasures and wild predicaments.I truly feel sorry for anyone who would dismiss the Hobbit as a \"children's book.\" While it may have been intended that way, it hardly reads as so. The Hobbit is intelligent, gripping, sophisticated and wondrous. I found that I always had a smile on my face for the greater portion of the book. Tolkien's vivid and often times comedic approach to Bilbo's situations help convey an intriguing and entertaining story that can be enjoyed by anyone.The characters, for the most part, are very well developed. The main characters (Bilbo, Thorin, Gandalf) get the most attention, but Tolkien balances the 12 remaning Dwarves and other side characters quite well. Bilbo's encounter with Gollum is chilling and memorable, and the finding of the Ring seems so very insignificant in the grand scheme of things...yet who would've known that such an innocent discovery would have led to the tragic, dark and terribly evil events to follow in Tolkien's legendary Lord of the Rings?This book should definitely keep you enthralled and reading to the very end. Like I said earlier, though this may have been intended to be a children's book, it hardly reads like one at all. I don't ever remember reading any books way back when I was a kid that were this epic, descriptive or intelligent. All you need is an open mind with a little twinge of fantasy, and you'll definitely enjoy the Hobbit. You can't read the Lord of the Rings without reading the Hobbit out of principle. I don't know why I waited so long to read this book, but now that I have, I am very glad that I did. It's probably one of the best books i've ever read. I very highly recommend it to anyone remotely interested in fantasy. Most of the fantasy today is inspired by The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings.This Leatherette Collector's Edition of the book sports some illustrations inserted into key areas of the book,gold embossment on the cover of elvish 'moonletters' and runes, as well as a leather sheath for the book. Definitely worthwhile for any Tolkien fan!

Anyway, it's a typical comment from an ignoramous who can't separate the author from his fictional creations. I think that Kirkus assumes that Franklin is backwards because he doesn't condescend to his characters. A lesser writer might, because there are some unattractive people here, but Franklin is much smarter than that. Although the Kirkus review is favorable, it does a disservice to his vivid and beautiful, if dark, book. And the stupid comment at the end (of the Kirkus review) really steams me!

Although very few are familiar with this 19th century British pastor, teacher, and evangelist, few will not be inspired by him. This account of his life and ministry may in fact be one of the most spiritually challenging books you may ever read!The book sets forth the qualities of true -- agape, loving -- Christian leadership:--Love for God's Word-- Spirit-controlled character-- Being patient and gentle-- Maintaining unity-- Disciplining and reconciling-- Practicing hospitality-- Giving to the needy-- Continuing consequencesand more. Some excerpts:To reform the church of God we should always begin with self-reform. Schisms and divisions will increase so long as we begin with reforming others. Wisdom is only with the lowly.Humility is the secret of fellowship, and pride the secret of division.The ruin of a kingdom is a little thing in God's sight, in comparison with division among a handful of sinners redeemed by the blood of Christ.The best testimony that Stephen bore was his last: not when preaching and working miracles, but when he pleaded for his persecutors; for then he most resembled the Lord Jesus in patience, forgiveness and love.(To a young missionary, heading for the field:) Keep low, look up, and press forward.The Bottom Line: This book offers a much needed corrective to the kind of corporate (= worldly) leadership styles that dominate most church fellowships today.

Their thoughts should not be free and so the few act in their churches, their schools and their universities, instilling prejudices.But, education should, instead, implant in the minds of the young an ineradicable horror of the slaughter which they are taught now to admire.State, Church, propertyThe chief end of all great States is power. The State itself is largely concerned in defending the privileges of the rich (the property owners). Many of the conflicts between States have their origin in the financial interests of a few plutocrats.Internally, it protects the rich against the poor. Externally, it uses force for competition with other States. For B. Russell, a nation State `which believes that its welfare can only be secured by suffering and inflicting hundreds of thousands of equally horrible sacrifices is a monstrous Moloch.'Churches have almost everywhere opposed political progress and progress in thought. Religion is more concerned to repress the life of the instinct and to combat the subversiveness of thought.Man in generalMen, like trees, require for their growth the right soil and sufficient freedom of oppression. The actual belief that all values may be measured in terms of money, and that money is the ultimate test of success in life, is a real mutilation of man's own nature.On the other hand, individuals can still do a lot, as has been shown by the movements for religious toleration and democracy, and against the subjection of women.One is amazed by the political, social, economical and humanitarian relevance of this book written nearly one hundred years ago. The actual world needs many more Bertrand Russells.A must read.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Great book, great pictures but maybe a bit difficult to execute for a non professional chef.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This book is for the one's who don't have time to read or know what style of writing they like. &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is a book that almost anyone can read in a day.

I have read it so many times that the cover is falling off and the spine is incredibly damaged. Basically, Pride and Prejudice focuses on Elizabeth Bennet, a young and independent woman whose mother is trying to marry off her and her sisters to the highest bidder. They have several suitors, including Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Wickham. At first glance, Pride and Prejudice seems just like a regular Regency romance (making you wonder why it is such a widely acclaimed book); however, it is much more than that.In Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen offers social commentary on a wide range of subjects, including corruption of the Church, marriage, and women's rights. In addition, each time I read it, I realize more and more that not only is Jane Austen a genius, but she also has a great sense of humor (this can been seen through Mr. Collins, the wordy church leader, Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth's social-climbing mother, and many of the other characters). Several of the minor characters are used as stereotypes in order to get Austen's point across (for example, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, one of the snobbiest rich women in all of literature, and Lydia, Elizabeth's flighty youngest sister).Even if you don't care about Jane Austen's views on the society of her time, Pride and Prejudice still offers a lot. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy have perfect chemistry, as do Jane and Mr. Bingley. Elizabeth is way ahead of her time--no women of her stature were expected to be picky about who they married, but Elizabeth is not willing to settle for anything but the best. Then of course, there's the idea that you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them and that you shouldn't let your pride get in the way of your opinions about others (hence the name Pride and Prejudice).This book is great for everyone-it contains romance, comedy, and even politics of Austen's time. Although the language might be hard to understand at first, it's definitely worth reading.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE& THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATESpreface by Roger PilonThis is probably the best-liked of all the pocket Constitutions out there due to its compact size and nice-looking appearance. It's height and width are roughly akin to a man's wallet, making it easy to carry andThe book begins with a preface by Roger Pilon of the CATO Institute. Pilon recommends that Americans should use the Declaration of Independence to provide a context for the more specific language in the Constitution. He points out that the Founders believed that our rights are inalienable and come from the principles of natural law. Our rights do not come from the government, and the government exists to protect our rights and defend the country. The Founders developed the system of enumerated powers so that no segment of government would hold too much power.Included are the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution and a list of amendments to the Constitution, including the Bill of Rights (the first 10 Constitutional amendments).This is the same version of the Constitution that Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) pulled out of his pocket during the MSNBC debates and on the Colbert Report television show. It is also the same one that Republican B.J. Lawson (called \"Ron Paul Jr.\") held up during the GOP primary race in North Carolina (he later won the nomination). Here's to any elected official who has read and understands the founding documents of this great country!\"Government officials must respect their oaths touphold the Constitution; and we the people mustbe vigilant in seeing that they do. The Foundersdrafted an extraordinarily thoughtful plan ofgovernment, but it is up to us, to each generation,to preserve and protect it for ourselves and forfuture generations. For the Constitution will liveonly if it is alive in the hearts of the American people.\"~Roger Pilon, pg. 7","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"As a previous reviewer noted, The Rich and Superrich is a very readable book despite its size. It is very edifying to see the money power structure in the US. Ferdinand Lundberg was a brilliant scholar and writer, living from 1905 to 1995.I would also recommend his previous book, written in 1937, but reissued in 2007--America's 60 Families. From this one can see that the concentration of power is nothing new.I would recommend two more books that show how democratization of the US economy can be achieved.I would also recommend Thom Hartmann's books on the constitution, which explain all the obstacles to a true democracy put in place by our founders. The US constitution was a compromise between those who wanted a plutocracy (Adams and Hamilton, for example) and those who wanted a true people's democracy (Franklin, Jefferson, Thomas Paine). We must remember that the US was the first modern democracy. Unfortunately, the compromises our founders made has led to a plutocracy, rather than a democracy.I also recommend: SHARING THE PIE by Stephen Brouwer, Owl Books.Sharing The Pie \"Offers a far more lucid presentation of economic trs than you are likely to find anywhere.\"--Barbara EhrenreichEven though it was published in 1998, the material is still relevant since it analyzes the structure of the economy, rather than the current picture of who owns what.As one reviewer noted about Sharing The Pie, it is an invaluable resource for those who want to make sense of the economy, Sharing the Pie is also a passionate plea for greater economic equality and a revitalization of American democracy.As recently as 2004, a reviewer noted Sharing The Pie \"gives a good history of how America's economy has gotten to the point it is now and where it may be going in the future.\"","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"STONEBROOK COTTAGE reminds me of why I'm a Carla Neggers fan.

They employ what tools and weapons that have been passed to them, but lack understanding. In short, their society is slipping backwards. With the hope of renewal, one man is sent home to bring back a much-needed \"god\" for his people. On Blue's Waters is the first part of Horn's story, of which he is the narrator. Though the basic story is simple, a good deal of strangeness happens from point A to point B, not all of it comprehensible. To complicate matters, Horn is an unfaithful narrator, and cannot always be trusted to give an accurate account of events. He admits to embellishing, or even outright lying-though he never says about what exactly. Knowing this forces a high degree of involvement on the reader, making us wonder what the real truth looks like underneath all the words. It can be taxing on a lethargic imagination, but also very rewarding. I took notes while reading; I marked passages, and underlined dialog. At times I felt I was studying rather than reading. There are few books that grip me like that.I highly recommend Wolfe for readers who aren't bothered by unsolved mysteries and inexplicable events. I find many similarities between Wolfe and M. John Harrison, especially the Viriconium series. Fans of one will surely appreciate the other.NOTE: On Blue's Waters is book one of the BOOK OF THE SHORT SUN.

I was hesitant to pick this up at first due to the bizarre subject matter, but my fears were put to rest instantly, for a couple reasons:1) the novel cannot be so narrowly defined as simply being about a hermaphrodite; it's about the American dream; racism; finding oneself; the difficulties and confusing emotions of adolescence; politics; the inextricable link between history and each human being affecting and being affected by it... put simply, it's about life. And:2) Eugenides' writing style is so descriptive and engaging that the reader is transported directly into the mind of the narrator, making the fact that Callie happens to be a hermaphrodite almost irrelevant--she\/he is just a normal person with a slightly unusual body.By the end of Book 3 I was convinced this was the best book I ever read. And then I read Book 4, the last 100 pages, and felt cheated, robbed somehow of the magic of the first 400 pages. The novel takes an exceedingly far-fetched and rambling turn; it is almost palpable that Eugenides was getting pressure from the publisher to wrap things up and rushed through the end of the book without really thinking through a satisfying conclusion. The writing style falls apart; the descriptiveness and magic is gone, and the story degenerates into a rather plain narrative of a freak's life. The real heart of the matter, how a seemingly normal person who happens to be a hermaphrodite copes with the discovery, never comes, and the 25 years of Callie's life between end of story and beginning of narration are never explained. Eugenides almost gives in to the freak factor by the end, leaving the reader with the lingering sensation upon finishing the book that Callie is merely a circus sideshow.So, proportional to the number of pages that I thought this book was great, it gets 4 out of 5 stars from me.

Milly could use a horse, among other things, and so Wormold agrees to be a spy-of a sort. But then he starts reporting elaborate lies back to his boss, and the fun-and disaster-ensues!

However, Rowling has created books with an excellent sense of plot, she throws in twists and turns that certainly threw me for a number of loops. She is amazing at crafting characters that are engaging, original and a lot of fun to spend a few hours with. To top all of this fact, let us not forget that these are books in a series. In the first book there is a sense of safety, that these are children's books and that a wave of a magic wand is all that is needed to make everything come out alright. But this series is slowly shifting as the books continue, and there is a presence looming at the end of the fourth book that clearly shows us that Dumbledore, the schoolmaster who bails Harry and his friends out here and there during their adventures, is NOT going to be able to wave his magic wand and make everything better. The stakes are raised by the end of the fourth book, the danger is very real and an epic battle is shaping up between good and evil.

But a crisis is on the rise - the UK is producing more and more money, yet it gets harder and harder to afford to buy items as prices rise. If matters weren't confusing enough, Barry's father goes and buys the family a large, looming house that's much too big for them, and begins putting up hundreds of shelves down in the basement.When the signs of the crisis begin to show, with food prices insanely high, the old are left to afford almost nothing, and the talk of food rationing begins. Barry's suspicions of his father grow. When he discovers his plans - to hoard several years' worth of nonperishable foods in their basement, hidden from the rest of the community - Barry's met with an important decision: To keep his family safe for the long haul and risk being discovered, or to go against his father's wishes and refuse the stores.NOAH'S CASTLE was originally published in the 1970's, so the book reads as a contemporary-historical novel, though that in no way detracts from the power of the story. Townsend has a great voice in Barry; simple but strong. While readers will identify with him, his sister Agnes, and some other characters that come along, the real star of the novel is Barry's father, Norman. Norman's character is written as amazingly complex, with every emotion and motive shaded grey. There is no easy side for the reader to take, and the excitement over the moral issues alone will keep you wanting to read. Action-wise, the story moves along quickly, each and every scene flowing with tension and emotions that really capture the dystopian setting.The setting, as mentioned, is one of the novel's strongest points. With novels like INCARCERON and HOW I LIVE NOW gaining acclaim in the same genre, this really stands out. What makes it do so is its believability. It has no magic or vampires, just the plain old world going through a realistic crisis. It almost scared me as to how easily I could see this happening. (And indeed, it actually did. Townsend based the events off of a German economic upheaval after World War I.) Every moment seems real, adding a horror novel-like aspect to it that's hard to shake away.Most notably, Townsend managed to write a novel with little fault to it. Some of the characters could have been fleshed out more, especially the women. Understandably, the time period reflects some of these behaviors, so it's not as bad as something that would be written and originally published today, but he still could have done more. What he did do was still intriguing enough to make me enjoy reading about them.Overall, it's an enjoyably quick read that will send your mind whirling.

His characters have depth and substance; alien environments are described in a sensible and believable manner; plot events are unexpectedly dramatic and logically propel the action.For the record in 1962 Ace published one of John Brunner's first novels title \"Secret Agent of Terra\" subtitled \"Vultures from the A-Power Orbit\". The cover featured a shapely woman in a skin tight space suit. Using lurid titles and a sexy or horror themed cover art was typical of 50's and 60's Ace marketing for their low budget SF line. Surprisingly many excellent novels were first published in these Ace editions and are highly desired by collectors. This book was part of an Ace Double and was 126 pages in length. In 1969 Dell published an expanded version of \"Secret Agents of Terra\" re-titled as \"The Avengers of Carrig\" at 157 pages. The cheesy cover and silly subtitle was replaced and the length was bulked up 31 pages. I have read both versions and prefer \"Avengers\" although it has, in my estimation, one of the worst covers ever slapped on a SF paperback.Unfortunately you will be hard pressed to find any of Brunner's 60 novels for sale in a bookstore. The sad fact is that none of his books have been reprinted in the last ten years.

There is a myriad of books available today on what it means to be a pastor, ranging from titles bashing church growth techniques to works heralding the modern-day pastor as a church CEO. This book covers the Biblical basics of shepherding for church leaders and pastors, and covers them well. The author acknowledges a place for managerial skill, but he asserts that the primary role of a church leader\/pastor is to shepherd the sheep.I recommend this book enthusiastically!","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"His Excellency by Joseph J. Ellis is the compelling and interesting biography of George Washington, the Father of Our Country. I've never really been interested in Washington; he's always seemed like more of a figurehead than a real person. History classes did nothing to change my opinion. But Ellis really brings Washington alive through excerpts of his correspondence and by analysis of his actions. I was telling my husband about the book and his response was that it made the first president seem actually interesting. I agree; Ellis has put flesh and blood upon the statue and made him real. Myths about the cherry tree as well as current political thought that Washington was a patriarchal egomaniac are blown to bits. Washington was a man of his time, but he also created his time and was a necessary figure not only in the bid for America's independence but also in her fight to become a nation. This book gave me new respect not just for Washington but for the other Founding Fathers as well.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Everytime I search a word within this dictionary: it hasn't been included!

But the whole thing hinges on the humanity of the invading soldiers - without that there's no meaning. And we all know about how human most Nazis were in their dealings with conquered people. So we're left with the sad sense of everyone taking their place on the Wheel of Life and playing their roles until death do us part. That is, it might have been more meaningful had the Nazi characters actually broken the mold big-time and translated some of their humanity into concrete actions useful to the populace instead of reverting to form and attempting half-heartedly the few stillborn sympathetic actions they did attempt.

The first is a doctor, and a southern romantic, and the other is a classic male chauvinist and the antagonist of the story. I found that parts of the story were a little rough, but the work as a whole was very enjoyable.The basic questions of why our society works the way it does causes the narrator to rethink his entire world view, and his views of civilized society.

It is written like he is an oral storyteller and is so engrossing as to make it difficult to put down. I originally thought due to the title that I would just read it aloud to my boys but I found when they had fallen asleep I couldn't stop and have since read this book at least three times and bought a used copy for all my nieces and nephews. The history is very one sided and from an Englishman's point of view he has a poor opinion of his royals with the Great Alfred being the first and last king of any esteem. His descriptions of the wars with the thousands of dead contrast sharply with the \"clean\" wars of today. Fields with thousands lying slaughtered is incomprehensible. Life was so cheap then at least as described by Dickens.

In few places is this more true than in history; few are the historians who have not built their works on the surer foundations of the historical giants who have gone before.In the study of the causes of America's Western expansion, Albert Weinberg's MANIFEST DESTINY: A STUDY OF NATIONALIST EXPANSION IN AMERICAN HISTORY is the giant all the other works are built upon. Be they written to attack the ideas first presented inside this book or be they dropping a citation this book's way every page, all the books written on Manifest Destiny find their source in Weinberg's MANIFEST DESTINY. If you were to read only one book on the topic, this book is it.Weinberg's book is primarily a history of the ideology that prompted and justified American expansion. While others have claimed that American expansionism was driven by economic or geopolitical concerns, Weinberg painstakingly connects the dots between American beliefs regarding democratic governance, millennialism, race theory, and international politics and actual government policy to paint a picture more complex and believable than the realist and economic determinist tracks would have you believe. The difficulty of such an endeavor is made all the greater by the scope of Weinberg's book, which starts with the expulsion of Seminoles and Cherokee and ends with the American acquisition of the Philippines. It is an ambitious undertaking, but one well performed nonetheless. Particularly valuable were the chapters detailing American expansionism in the 1840s, which, being the time when ideology and policy were most closely intertwined, lends itself the best to Weinberg's approach.Perhaps most surprisingly, MANIFEST DESTINY's argument reads as a modern work, despite is publication date (1935). Weinberg was not afraid to discuss racism's relationship with expansion, nor was he hesitant to attack America's imperialists for their faults. I am not the only one who thinks this - even book written in the last decade (likethis one) have cause to cite it often.IN SUM: This book is a forgotten gem.

That Something escapes, life as we know it is threatened, and the hero battles greedy corporations who think they can reestablish control and make billions by stuffing the genie back in its bottle.There&#65533;s nothing wrong with recycling this old theme. Even the supposed original, \"Frankenstein,\" echoes the Greek myth of Icarus, whose wax wings melted when he flew too close to the sun. The success of such stories depends on the cautionary tale they attempt to tell, and this one&#65533;s target is a good one: nanotechnology. Better, Crichton avoids the \"gray goo\" clich&eacute; in which runaway nanomachines eat up everything in their paths, like a plague of molecular locusts. Here, the real culprit is computer-driven nanotechnology that is capable of evolving so quickly that nobody can understand it, let alone control it.To enjoy a Crichton novel, you have to be able to accept certain things as givens:1. The story is a vehicle for the science. This one must contain at least 50 pages of exposition about computers, nanotechnology, and biology. Crichton would have made a good science writer.2. The story will start at the beginning and proceed in sequential manner (except, in this case, for a brief preface). \"Prey\" doesn&#65533;t really get rolling for about 100 pages.3. Characters are not Crichton&#65533;s strong point. Here the protagonist is better developed than most of Crichton&#65533;s leads&#65533;but then he undercuts his \"sensitive male\" characterization by dashing off into the desert when the plot requires him to do so, risking his life repeatedly and never once questioning what will happen to his children if he dies. Too bad: there would have been a lot more tension if the hero had been more conflicted.4. Crichton has always been weak when it comes to endings. \"Andromeda Strain\" was a great book, but the ending is a severe anticlimax, and the same can be said about \"Sphere,\" \"Congo,\" and several others. I suspect that Crichton, a scientist at heart, has trouble venturing too far afield from reality. That makes for good near-future science fiction concepts&#65533;and poor endings.That said, this book&#65533;s ending is a pleasant surprise. There&#65533;s plenty of action, and a resolution that fits appropriately into the story buildup&#65533;even if there are a few disconcerting moments when you realize that you&#65533;re seeing a movie outline more than a book.Bottom line: if you like Crichton, you&#65533;ll like this book. Conversely, if you don&#65533;t like this book, don&#65533;t buy any of his others.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I am an avid reader and it is rare that I find a book that would warrant a rating of &quot;5&quot;.

MacDonald's classic \"Travis McGee\" series.The fast, taut \"Nightmare in Pink\" is set in New York City and its environs and concerns white collar crooks scamming millions from unsuspecting investors. I expected a decent story, and more than got that, but what I didn't expect was a scary one. I mean, horror-novel scary. And I got a kick out of being caught unaware like that.You see, the crooks here have a very special way of lulling their marks into submission, and, just as chilling, of getting the curious and other threats to their scam out of the way. I won't get too specific, but let's just say these methods involve shady physicians, unsupervised mental health facilities, and certain controversial (even in the early 60's, when this story is set) cranial operations involving long, thin, shiny implements. And, yes, our man McGee gets into quite a spot involving these factors. Will his sharp mind survive the book intact?In addition to the chills and suspense, other satisfying elements include a nicely drawn friendship between McGee and an old war buddy, an eventual romance with the war buddy's daughter (which gallant McGee tries to resist at first), and McGee's usual, and still fascinating, mental pronouncements about this or that aspect of American life. It helps that McGee's opinions about things still resonate and make us nod in agreement more than forty years after MacDonald wrote them.It's been said that this series didn't really start to pick up stream until about the fifth or sixth book. If that's the case, those upcoming books must REALLY be good, because \"Nightmare in Pink\" and the entry before it are both fine, satisfying reading experiences, laced with thrills, emotion, intelligence, and surprises.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"\"It was about eleven o'clock in the morning, mid October, with the sun not shining and a look of hard wet rain in the clearness of the foothills.

I was neat, clean, shaved and sober, and I didn't care who knew it. I was everything the well-dressed private detective ought to be. I was calling on four million dollars.\"- Philip Marlowe in The Big SleepAnd thus began the criteria for what a private eye would look like and what his moral code would be. Raymond Chandler, author of the Philip Marlowe series of crime novels, set the bar high and generations would follow in his writing footsteps.Raymond Chandler is considered to be one of the most influential writers of crime fiction and his phenomenal creation of the detective Philip Marlowe has survived decades.Every time a modern reader discovers a new private eye who is facing some interesting and very tough times but is able to do it with integrity and a strict moral code alongwith a \"soldier's eye\"; you are meeting Raymond Chandler the writer all over again. And Philip Marlowe his creation is playing a pivotal role in the background.Raymond Chandler wrote seven detective novels but THE BIG SLEEP is probably his best. He was fifty years old when he wrote this novel yet this novel would become an American landmark in the hard-boiled detective genre and would really launch him into the icon that he is today.The reader will discover a unified theme with strong and fully developed characters with incredible imagery and metaphors. Chandler's literary style is distinctive and very crisp. You will love this book. If you are new to hard-boiled detective stories, this is the novel that I would start withYou will be introduced to the Sternwoods: General Sternwood, Vivian and Carmen and all three are interesting studies and all three as General Sternwood notes hasn't \"any more moral sense than a cat.\" General Sternwood is on his deathbed and hired Philip Marlowe to check out why he was being blackmailed by one Arthur Gwynn Geiger. His two daughters, Vivian and Carmen, are quite a handful but General Sternwood feels in part responsible for his plight. As he tells Marlow, \"I need not add that a man who indulges in parenthood for the first time at the age of fifty-four deserves all he gets.\" He describes his two daughters as being \"spoiled, exacting, smart and ruthless with the younger girl as being the type who likes to pull wings off flies\".Chandler's novels do highlight crooks and morally-corrupt characters and derelicts, but they are counter-balanced by Marlowe, Bernie Ohls, and General Sternwood--all of whom possess a strong sense of honor, a consideration of what is proper and are for the most part trying to live a life above board.There are numerous murders that take place and a tight interwoven plot which will keep you on the edge of your seat until you get to the last page.When THE BIG SLEEP was published in 1939 there was only an advance of 5,000 copies by Alfred A. Knopf. However, Knopf knew the power and the contribution that this novel would make. They actually took out an advertisement for this book on the front cover of the Publisher's Weekly which was most unusual for a novelist's first book.The dust jacket flaps read:\"Not since Dashiell Hammett appeared has there been a murder mystery story with the power, pace, and terrifying atmosphere of this one. And like Hammett's this is more than a \"murder mystery\": it is a novel of crime and character, written with uncommon skill in a tight, tense style which is irresistible.\"And so it was. I would highly recommend reading this crime novel and being introduced to Philip Marlowe.

I wasn't sure if I would be of the no-cry camp or the let-them-cry-it-out side. This book actually answered the question for me!The author describes how a newborn, up to 4 months, should NEVER be allowed to just cry it out. They cry because they need something but they have not yet developed the ability to link a parental attention to crying and cannot play \"games\". The author encourages parents to do whatever you feel is needed to sooth the newborn, including rocking or nursing to sleep. After four months the author said the child can learn to \"fake cry\" to elicit a parental response. This is when he recommends listening for types of cries and begining to \"extinguish\" the crying behavior by slightly delaying your response, especially to fake cries and night whimpers.The author is strongly in favor of ample sleep for children. He explains how much they need (it's surprising) and that parents should watch for symptoms of drowsiness and put the baby down drowsy. NOT fully awake and not crashed-out asleep. There is extensive talk about what to do with problem sleepers. All solutions involve watching for the baby\/toddler to become drowsy (slowing down play, rubbing eyes) and putting them to bed then. A few minutes of fussing will probably follow, at which time you are to check on them periodicaly, but a swift drift off into sleep is always on the heels of the protest. Most all-night sleep battles are with overtired children whose bodies are producing stress hormones to keep them miserably awake. Putting to bed while drowsy (even at 6 pm in the evening) produces much happeir, more alert and more agreeable children.He cites endless studies about how sleep makes for happier, healthier babies and how IQ has been directly linked to sleep. (Children with an IQ above 140 have been shown to get 30-40 more minutes of sleep than their peers. That's how important daytime naps and scheduled bedtimes are!)I very much liked this book set because I felt it gave me some very good, scientific advice about how to comfort my newborn and how to change my behavior as my baby develops to ensure he has the best possible start at getting good, healthy sleep.

First of all, you must appreciate the novel being written in 1935 and the language spoken by the characters reflect that time period, rightly so. It only takes a short while to adapt and I found the story moving along at a nice pace as the personalities began to assume colorful portrayals.Steinbeck presents a group of men, or paisanos living in Monterey, California after the first World War. These are poor men, not especially motivated to work for a living and have a thirsty, never ending longing for wine. They circle around Danny, the fortunate one in the group, who inherited 2 small houses from his grandfather. Having no steady job, it makes sense to him to &quot;rent&quot; to his buddies. His buddies don't have jobs or revenue, either, so the compensation that takes place is in the form of companionship and the collective sharing of all foods begged from the back doors of groceries and restaurants. The hawking of whatever goods they come upon that can be bartered for the prized gallon of wine serves to be their highest priority. While seemingly desperate and pathetic, these men go to no end to rationalize their predicaments, twist truths and events to be self-serving and ultimately rewarding their endeavors by securing enough wine to satisfy them all. This can be quite a challenge, and the lengths they go to to fulfill their thirsty desires are hilarious. That the reader finds love and goodness in these fellows is reflected by the skill of John Steinbeck's writing.The book is a quick read and it was not long before I became fond and wiped away a few tears of sorrow and joy for each of them and the circumstances these men find themselves. The practise of their Catholic religion is random; they use it when they need it, commit small crimes in the name of it and dismiss the many restrictive &quot;Thou shall not's&quot; when seized in the throes of passion or inebriation. A greater sense of loyalty knits these men to each other. While women acquaintances come and go, the paisanos rely on each other and faithfully commit to one another. In spite of the inevitable drunken fights and arguments, the following morning beckons another day. All the sins of the previous day are (literally) forgotten and forgiven. In the dawn of the new day anything is possible, and the adventures these men get themselves into is pure comic entertainment.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"It doesn't delve into the world of the wolf, presenting many facts and details.

The recently landed lord finds that the aristocracy in England may have titles and manors, but very little money to pay for upkeep. Lord Towcester must find some sort of employ that allows him to raise funds, but his grand scheme goes absurdly awry.Bill Towcester and Jeeves decide to employ their knowledge of horse racing to earn those funds, hiding their true identities through disguises, and making a tidy profit for themselves. Then comes Captain Biggar, a hunter with a strict honor code, who makes an unlikely bet that miraculously wins, but leaves Lord Towcester without the cash to pay up. He takes off and Captain Biggar follows him, and hilarity ensues. For not only must Bill keep his identity secret from the angry captain, but also from his beloved fiancee who knows nothing of his venture. And as if Lord Towcester didn't have enough chaos in his life, his sister brings along an American lady who might be interested in purchasing his home and solving all of his problems. Too bad for him that she is a woman he once romanced while on vacation, one he never told his fiancee about.\"The Return of Jeeves\" is a quick-paced and witty comedic read. P.G. Wodehouse makes the intelligent and know-it-all Jeeves a likeable character, who charms and quotes his way thorugh absurd and trying situations. As Lord Towcester manages to enmesh himself even more deeply into a problematic situation, readers will wonder how all will possibly be solved, and happily at that. And they will laugh all the way through to the end.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"*Spoilers Throughout*Kate, daughter of a whore, but raised by nuns is finally taking her life into her own hands. For months she's been corresponding with Reed in Texas. They get married via proxy and she comes to claim her husband. But when she gets there her new \"husband\" has never heard of her and she discovers that it was Reed's father who wrote to her all those months, trying to get his son a bride. Reed is less than pleased. Reed has brought home his son Daniel, believed dead in the same raid that killed his mother, but instead he was taken and raised by the Comanche. Reed gets Kate to take care of Daniel until he can arrange an annulment.I have to start out by saying to me this book isn't a romance, it seems like it wants to be, but I never bought into any of the romantic elements. The first sex scene (1 of 2) was utterly bizarre. She is yet to actually say hello to the man because he was brought in wounded when she shows up. She thinks he is her husband and she goes to check on him as he is having a fever dream. Reed thinks she is his first wife, Becky, and afterwards they just forget about it. It's very weird that a woman RAISED BY NUNS is going to be so laid back about casual sex, that she isn't going to demand he does the right thing for her, that she isn't worried about a possible baby or something. I never believed that Reed cared for her and at the end I didn't believe that he actually loved her.For me I was much more invested in the storyline involving Reed's son, Daniel, or Fast Pony, as he calls himself. It seemed honest and realistic as we learn about his loyalty to his adopted family and also as he comes to terms with who his real father is and bonds with Kate. Also the character of Charm was, well, charming. She is a young former whore whom Kate befriends. All the characters are likable, there are no villains there. Even the Comanche are portrayed as sympathetic. The problem I have with this book is Reed. Everyone is so likable and real, while Reed might be real but he's not very likable. He is a typical wounded hero, who's wife ran around on him, holds himself responsible for losing his son and his wife's death and had a toxic relationship with his father. These are the kinds of heroes I just eat up, but Reed was too cold, he didn't care about any one or any thing and I couldn't feel any sympathy for him in the slightest.I know I am being rather negative, but I really did enjoy this book. It's a traditional western with cowboys and indians, saloons, and hot Texas sun, and if you don't mind that the romance here is a bit on the shallow side you will definitely enjoy this book.4 1\/2 stars.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This book delivers on its title.

Collins tells the story from the point of view of several of the principal characters, providing lots of clues and suspects toward the eventual resolution of the crime. His cast of original characters, his subtle social commentary, and some primitive forensics are an added bonus.\"The Moonstone\" opens with the theft of the diamond by a British soldier during a battle in India. The diamond is eventualy inherited by Miss Rachel Verinder on the ocassion of her 18th birthday, only to vanish under mysterious circumstances which undermine her intended engagement to Mr. Franklin Blake. Blake will have no choice but to solve the mystery if he is to salvage his relationship with Rachel.Blake will be assisted in his navigation of the twists and turns of the plot by Sergeant Cuff of the Metropolitan Police Force, a literary predecessor of Lt. Columbo if ever there was one. The pursuit of the clues will lead to some astonishing discoveries, and eventually to the key to the mystery.\"The Moonstone\" is very highly recommended to detective fiction fans with the patience to work through Collins' rather round-about way of getting to the truth of the mystery.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I am so glad I happened upon this book!

Rarely does one find a book that balances medical terminology and its great detail with the emotional and spiritual aspects of the patients' experience, but this book does. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone that is beginning the journey of infertility as it clearly gives medical information. More important to me, though, was the biblical content that reminds us that we are NOT alone through this process, that God is still God, and that the emotional roller coaster is a normal thing.

Garrard was an exuberant 17 year old tourist in the Old West of 1846-1847. He traveled down the Santa Fe Trail with a wagon train and stopped off at Bent's Fort on the Arkansas River of Colorado and spent a couple of months with the Cheyenne Indians and the traders and mountain men who lived around the fort. When Governor Charles Bent of New Mexico and twenty others were killed in Taos in an Mexican\/Indian uprising he joined an informal expedition of mountain men to take revenge. His group arrived after the U.S. army had recaptured Taos, but Garrard was in Taos for the trial and hanging of nine of the revolutionary trouble-makers, even loaning the hangman several lariats when he ran short. \"Wah-to-yah\" is said to be the only account of the trial and hanging of the Taos revolutionaries.Garrard was a lot more tolerant than most travelers, obviously enjoying the company of the Cheyennes and his extravagant and untutored White companions. He feels the need to express himself occasionally about moral issues and the lack of civilized values of the Indians, Mexicans, and other prairie dwellers - but his condemnations are rote rather than persuasive. Garrard, we imagine, probably shared buffalo robes with comely young Cheyenne women and thoroughly enjoyed the experience, as he did buffalo hunting, dog-meat feasts, and tall tale sessions with the mountain men. He also demonstrates a moral core, condemning the U.S war against Mexico and the wholesale hanging of the revolutionaries in Taos -- sentiments which were not popular in the West at the time.\"Wah-to-yah\" -- the Indian name for the Spanish Peaks of southern Colorado -- is perhaps the best account you will find of a young man's adventures in the Old West of mountain men and unconquered Indians. It is similar to Francis Parkman's \"The Oregon Trail.\" The two young men were in the West during the same year but Garrard's book is \"the fresher, the more revealing, the more engaging, the less labored\" in the words of A. B. Guthrie's introduction to \"Wah-to-yah.\" Garrard is a likeable person; Parkman is not. Both were keen observers and good writers.\"Wah-to-yah\" is on the short list of essential books about the Old West. It's easy and engaging reading. We need an annotated edition, however, which will tell us more about the many characters - some of them famous, such as Kit Carson -- Garrard meets and the places he visits and put the book in its historical context of its times.Smallchief","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Puzo really takes you back to pre-war \"Hells Kitchen\". His descriptions are vivid and engaging. Like many of his other books, this one is about family. The reader is shown a struggling mother and her children over a 20 year period.

They are the rock that their family and this story are built upon. Its a testament of how stong women can pull a family up by its bootstraps despite the failings of the men.Puzo's use of Italian (proper, dialect and slang) brings the characters close to home for those readers of Italian-American decent.

Anyone could identify with her situation if they concentrate on the book with an open mind, and it is basically a look at the thoughts\/emotions of a Creole woman who finds herself in an affair, but the book has many more elements to it that make it mean much more than a typical love &amp; infidelity story.

Those relate to his naval mastery. To understand Nelson as an admiral, a warrior and a hero, see the new books by Joel Hayward, Brian Lavery, Jo Callo and, for Nelson's early career, John Sugden. Remember also that the doyen of Nelson studies, Colin White, has just published NELSON THE NEW LETTERS, which is an invaluable source collection.Now, is Vincent's book good on the stuff that I'm not personally that interested in? The short answer is YES. Mr Vincent has researched admirably and painstakingly and created a three-dimensional portrait of the little fellow that generally rings true.Vincent's Nelson is vainglorious, passionate, complex, humane and sometimes a bit foolish. We knew all that, but Mr Vincent has depicted all these qualities and weaknesses with considerable empathy and an obvious unwillingness to sensationalise or trivialise.The book itself is a handsome volume, one that looks as good as it reads.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I originally picked this book up at our local library and right there in the aisle I started flipping through it.

A member of the anti-Castro movement from the age of 17, Rodriguez was infiltrated into Cuba six weeks before the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, and was one of only 15 of the original group of 35 infiltrators who escaped after the invasion failed. In 1967, as CIA advisor to the Bolivian Army, he helped to capture Che Guevara and was the last person to interrogate him. In Vietnam Rodriguez led and advised an elite anti-guerilla force until injuries caused his premature retirement. He was also a major figure in the American support of the Nicaraguan Contras and his claims that they were being poorly equipped, claims which Oliver North failed to heed, were ultimately proved correct during the Congressional Iran\/Contra hearingsI found this book interesting reading from start to finish. For someone without any knowledge of Cuba (such as myself), Felix Rodriguez offers a fascinating glimpse at Fidel Castro, the anti-Castro movemement and to what motivated and still motivates much of the opposition to Castro. Rodriguez' assessment of the whole Bay of Pigs fiasco and the CIA's approach to Latin and South America is insightful and worth reading the book for on it's own. His account of the tracking down and execution of Che Guevara in Bolivia covers another very interesting couple of chapters. Rodriguez certainly offered Guevara a lot more respect that Guevara ever offered any of his political opponents.I also found the later chapters on Vietnam and the Contra operations in Nicaragua well-written and interesting as well as all the smaller side-missions, such as time spent in Argentina and arms deliveries to the Maronites in Lebanon. There's also quite a good collection of B&W; photos in the book. Rodriguez is fairly critical of the CIA, and makes a couple of comments early in the book on the general insularity of most Americans, with their lack of knowledge \/ awareness of the world outside of the United States. All fair criticism, and not out of place or context. Rodriguez comes across as an idealist throughout the book, very strongly motivated by his anti-Castro beliefs, which he has always maintained. All in all, a shrewed and honorable man who deserves a lot of respect.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"`A Clockwork Orange' is one of those novels you don't expect to make the impact it does. When I first purchased the novel it was simply because I wanted some shock-therapy so-to-speak. I wanted to read something daring and edgy and a novel tagged with the `ultra-violence' moniker must be both. Well it is both daring and edgy, to the extreme even, but as most every reviewer has stated, this book is so much more than just a mishmash of violence. Inside this novel beats the heart of modern society and it asks questions we all do well to ponder.Anthony Burgess paints a haunting picture of a world torn about by violence. Alex (Your humble narrator) is a fifteen year old punk, a bossy irresponsible rebel of the extreme kind. He rules the streets with his droogs (fellow gang members), pillaging as it were. The first few chapters give the reader a glimpse not only into these teens' actions but also their attitude towards them. They have absolutely no sense of justice or consequence, and in a way they have no idea they're doing anything wrong. The novel takes a turn when Alex pushes too many buttons and his friends turn on him, selling him out to the cops and he ends up a prisoner of the State.It's here that the novel becomes that `classic' or `masterpiece' everyone keeps talking about. Once Alex is imprisoned he goes through many changes, but it's the cause of those changes that makes all the difference. Forced to become a walking robot, stripped of his free will and programmed to be the perfect citizen, Alex becomes a model example of everything that is wrong with society.Anthony Burgess's fantastic vision asks so many questions and the reader can't help but try to answer them. How should we feel about Alex? Did he get what he deserved? Did he get away with too much? Was his rehabilitation extreme or justified? The reader is forced to hate, even loathe this boy one minute, but only the heartless wouldn't feel pain for him towards the end.`A Clockwork Orange' changed the way I look at literature for it provides a balanced look at life and the decisions we make. It makes a statement more so then just tells a story. It exposes human emotions and inner workings, the darkest parts inside of us that we keep hidden from us all. Upon finishing this novel I was forced to ask myself, \"aren't we all the same?\" and it's a question I feel this novel addresses well. Everyone is appalled at the life Alex is living and the horrendous acts he commits, but isn't his punishment, his `treatment' as it were, just as masochistic?","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I purchased this book for my friend who is a pilot after reading about it in a catalog, where their price was $50.

I wanted an eating plan that emphasized natural, whole foods as opposed to processed and refined foods. Unfortunately, most of those types of cookbooks were for vegetarians or vegans. We believe that God created animal products for our nourishment as well as plant products, so we were not interested in becoming vegetarians or vegans. When I ran across this cookbook, I was thrilled. I had the original 1970's LaLeche League Cookbook and liked it, but it is out of date as far as our current nutritional knowledge goes. So I was glad to see that they had produced a newer cookbook.Pros:1)Outstanding cover and binding! Every cookbook should be so well made.2)Recipes from, and tested by, \"real\" people as opposed to fancy chefs or paid testers.3)Whole foods, but not \"weird\" ingredients4)Nutrition information after each recipe so special diets can be followed if needed.5)Divided by breakfast foods, lunches, snacks, breads, dinners, desserts, home-made versions of store bought products.6)More than just a cookbook-many helpful comments. For example: \"This is a great recipe for busy mothers. Assemble in the morning while you are getting breakfast.\" or \"This goes well with poultry.\"7)Offers many alternative ingredient choices8)Got two books for the price of one from LaLeche League. Whole Foods From the Whole World was included.Con:The last edition was in 1993. A new edition needs to be done to include the lastest information in nutrition. For example, recipes in this cookbook used carob in place of chocolate. Research has since determined that carob is no more nutritious than cocoa. Chocolate has been found to contain valuable antioxidants.Also, any type of vegetable oil is used in the recipes. The cookbook does not reflect knowledge about the differences in oils and the dangers of transfats. However, it appears that no hydrogenated products are used in the recipes and one can use current knowledge to use the correct oils since the recipes don't specify which oils.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"One of the joyous facts of all of Pink's works is his use of scripture to prove, explain and clarify scripture.

This is a fine approach if one has 9 to 15 or more t-shirts to use in a single quilt. The two authors have gone beyond that and created quilts where the block design is of equal importance to the t-shirt. Some quilts only have space for 5 t-shirts; others use more and most designs are theme-based, though the themes can certainly be adapted to the shirts one has on hand. The initial steps of the process, such as fusing stabilizer to the t-shirt fabric, are explained. The designs are clever and instructions are clear enough for intermediate quilters. I recommend this to people who are looking for creative alternatives to the simple grid for their t-shirt quilts.Addendum: I just finished a quilt from one of their patterns and found the sewing instructions to be incorrect.

You might not have a lot of money, but you can do one thing that's free, and that's to love. Francie Nolan is inside of all of us, the eleven year old girl who has her life set out for her: flowers in a brown bowl, read a book every day in alphabetical order until you reach the Z's, have a lot of children. She wants to win everything on a board that she spends a bit at every Saturday; right down to the skates and the doll with real hair: she yearns for what she may never get. Her family is poor and lives in the tenements of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. She and her brother Neeley do not know to be ashamed of their father and Francie has scant knowledge that her father has a bad reputation. Her mother works hard and her aunt &quot;gets around&quot;, as the writer calls it. She may be poor, but she has a loving family. She wants to be an author when she grows up and pay attention to children; she is upset with the librarian at the Brooklyn library who does not even look up at the poor little girl who comes in every day to check out a book that is good for an eleven year old. Francie is pleased when a book she loves is chosen; she symbolizes an everyday, American girl. We grow up with Francie; book one chronicles the life of an eleven year old girl that is so everyday, repetitive, that it shows everything is all right. The customs and the traditions prove that Francie's life has a rhythm to it, nothing bad happens. Book two chronicles life early on, as her parents meet and have their children and Francie grows older as things happen. And book three proves that you must grow up, as Francie enters college and begins a new life that only the reader can imagine what happens next. So read this book. Just read it, and you'll be glad you did.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I was kind of skeptical of this book in the beginning, after all, a book that has like three generations of families, half of them with the same name is really confusing. In addition, it seemed that I could find any good characters in this book. Even the main character has faults that I would look down upon. This book centers around the revenge of the main character Heathcliff. After trudging along several chapters I found this book to be quite interesting.This book incorporates a lot of gothic elements within the book. Emily Bronte conveys a deep horror and arouses our morbid curiosity with this. One will find many supernatural elements and suspenseful atmosphere within this book, and even a ghost! Because Bronte writes this book through the eyes of several characters, it is hard to judge the objectivity of the story, forcing readers to determine for themselves whether or not certain actions were justified. In the retellings through one character who used to care for Heathcliff's lover, she consistently paints him as the antagonist, emphasizing his faults and his actions against the family. This makes the book that much more interesting to read.The story of Wuthering Heights is a really complicated love story that focuses mainly on Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw. Through Bronte's appeal to pathos, she is able to convey and build up the romance between Heathcliff and Catherine. When she dies, Heathcliff, literally becomes a monster mentally, and Bronte applies this to a figurative level, describing him as a monster too. This also reveals the inner turmoil he experiences upon her death.Emily Bronte definitely writes on par with her sister Charlotte Bronte. Emily's work on Wuthering Heights, with her use of pathos and figurative language definitely makes it a classical gothic romance novel with a novel storyline.It is a beautifully written book that is full of human emotion from the seemingly cold and calculating Heathcliff. After the death of Catherine he burns for revenge. It is a great book, one just needs to get through the first couple of chapter to realize this. The conclusion is also satisfactory and provides for a good release of tension and an epiphany-like ending.I find this book to be a good read, because it has some adult themes, I would not exactly advise little kids to read it, but I am sure that anyone who appreciates literature would be \"wowed\" and amazed by this book.

I will merely comment on the physical qualities of the book itself. I'm not keen on omnibus or \"complete works\" type of books of any genre, as I typically find them to be fat, baggy, and unwieldy. This one is no exception even if it is leaner than most and touted as \"signature classics.\" Though it appears to be satisfactorily produced, with reasonable, though not fine, quality rag paper, and a decent readable font, I'm not happy with its large size, which resembles more of an atlas or coffee table book one would normally expect from a book on photography or art.It's just not the sort of book one would take from the shelf to a coffee shop for a read or feel comfortable in penciling and underlining. Nor am I particularly impressed with its silver-toned spine, something designed to please those whose tastes run to red carpets and velvet paintings of Elvis and chrome-edged dinette sets. Alas, I should have checked out this book more closely before I made my purchase. In any case, all is not lost. I plan to palm the book off as a gift on some unsuspecting friend, who will in turn believe that I must be the very soul of generosity to gift him with such a fine book with which he can secretly give to his buxom girlfriend, whom he desperately desires to impress, but whom nonetheless will refuse his sexual advances because she hates anything silver-colored.Ah, such is life in the Signature Classics lane.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I agree with the other reviewers. I first read this book in grade school and it is my favorite Oz book. I still re-read it from time to time, twenty years later. It's a great book for kids or adults who like fantasy. One caveat: just like the Grimm fairy tales, the Oz books are a lot more violent than many modern kids stories. The main characters are often threatened with gruesome violence (though it never comes to pass). I find this refreshing but parents might want to read the stories with their children so they can talk about it.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Since book six of the Wheel of Time series, I have felt like Robert Jordan has been making us wait a year for half-hour installments of a soap opera. This book reads and feels like a screen play for Dallas or As The World Turns. Characters make decisions that seem oh so important (Or in the case of Elayne, Utterly BORING, trivial, and not worth the 200 pages of space). The most interesting developments in the book (Mat and Tuon, Rand, etc.) are left only partially explored, and we have to wait for the next book for resolution (we hope.)Either Robert Jordan has gotten lazy and is merely relying on fluff, lost track of the story, or forgotten how to write. His book is like a box of Krispy Kreme donuts - delicious, but decided light bodied and leaving you wanting more substance. He has stopped writing in the compelling manner that in the first five or six books made you feel you were adventuring right along with the main characters. No, we just sit back and watch as the characters agonize (and it is agonizing to read) or what to do for 5 chapters. When this series first started there was more substance in the first 100 pages of any book than what has happened in entire 680 pages of Cross Roads of Twilight. As much fun as I had reading this series, this book left me feeling empty and like I had gorged on a whole box of Crispy Kremes.To Robert Jordan - write like you are capable of, before you lose a fan.","sentiment_score":0.4},{"review":"&quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is quite simply one of the best books I have ever read--it has stayed with me long after I finished it, and it is one of a handful of books I've bothered to read twice. While a few readers have utterly missed the point and dismissed McCourt's memoir as &quot;too depressing&quot; or &quot;repetitive&quot;, he has achieved one of the goals of great literature: &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; takes you into a life and world that is far beyond the imaginings of most readers, and makes it live and breathe. Though now in his sixties, he skillfully narrates his story through the perspective of the child he once was, perfectly conveying a child's fear, confusion and occasional obliviousness to the bleakness of his life, his mother's sufferings, and his fathers alcoholic rampages. Through it all he writes with grace, tenderness, irony, and even humor-- and not a shred of self-pity. McCourt's childhood was certainly hell, and the miracle is not that he not only survived it, but did so with his humanity and compassion intact. The normal pains of an average childhood, which so many people seem to want to blame for all their adult failures, pales to insignificance by comparison. You may never look at your own life in the same way once you have finished it.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Like Water for Chocolate, written by Laura Esquivel is a romantic story about forbidden love. It is set in old Mexico, and carries the rich traditional flavours of Mexico. This magical story is based around the all female De La Ganza family.

The novel holds suspence and enhances laughter and tears. Laura Esqquivel, the author, ahs done a marvellous job at creating realism throughout the novel. You will have a visual picture in your mind of the settings of Mexico and the characters. All the characters are believable you will instantly grasp an opinion of them within the first chapter of the novel.I think Like Water for Chocolate is an excellent novel that is worth while reading. I am sure that you will obtain something form reading it.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Garry Disher has another winner with Kittyhawk Down.

Nevertheless, it was enjoyable despite young Miss Austen's profuse mistakes, which made for hard reading at times. It is amazing that Austen had the perception to write social satire at the level she did at such a young age.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"This is an interesting look at the significance of Gilgamesh in relation to other ancient literature. It includes a lot of insightful information on what different parts of the Epic represent in terms of the Sumerian and Babylonian civilizations. For the most part, she uses Alexander Heidel's translation of the epic for her observations. The only weakness of this book as far as I am concerned, is that it was put together after the author's death, and much of it is clearly based on her lectures. I think if she had a chance to organize her materials into book form, the result would have been even better. As it is, this is still a very good resource for those interested in learning more about the Gilgamesh epic.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Deep, profound, complicated and eventually simple, like all truths....I have had this book for several years, I have read parts of many times and I am just about to delve into it yet again.

His book provides some interesting insights into the great author's writing process and into his personality, as well. For Conradians, Curle is an indispensible source. Jocelyn Baines provides the background. Curle provides the personal reflection, as when he describes Conrad's being subject to &quot;paroxyms of fury, into which he could be plunged by people who, for one reason or another, had angered him.&quot;We don't usually think of the stolid, placid, stoical Conrad as being a human being who could occasionally blow his top. Curle brings him down to earth a bit, as when he reports that Conrad was notoriously afraid of &quot;losing his self-possession, even for a moment.&quot; Certainly the pictures of the author that have come down to us try to convey the image of the steady-going voyager and captain, ever-composed and thoroughly self-possessed. Curle's depiction shows us another side to this enigmatic author. One that historians and scholars should not overlook when investigating the great man's works.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I've tried just about every way of eating there is and I have to say that this way of eating makes the most sense, at least for me, and I'd bet many many other people would also benefit from it, if not all people.Mixed proteins make good sense and are easier to digest and absorb vs. eating a lot of one type of high stress protein.Complex Carb meals at lunch and suppertime seem to be a good idea for me so that I can maintain my weight. I personally found that 2 PV meals a day seems to make me lose more weight than I want to lose, but would be very helpful to anyone wanting to lose weight and improve their health.I refer this book to anyone that tells me they'd like to improve their health.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 9\/20\/2010 :Several years ago I drifted away from this way of eating, and without realizing it I gradually went down to a lower level of health.Organic foods are not enough. They must be combined well or they create toxic by products that affect health in many ways.It's more time & effort to eat this way, but it's really worth it, and it's necessary. My back started to bother me again recently, even though I had not injured it again, and I took that as a sign that I really needed to make a change in diet and quit eating all of the fruit I was eating. After just a week of being on this way of eating, my back feels a lot more stable. The fact is, proteins have a lot to do with joint health and many other things. I'm not sure just what was going on with my body, but it's better now and I'm thankful of this diet to quickly turn it around. We definitely ARE what we eat. If I had kept on the way I was eating, I really believe I would have been needing a cane to walk in the near future. Don't wait to find out the hard way, eat this way now and always.I was just like the person he refers to in the book that kept eating sweet fruits and juices all day in an effort to try to increase energy. I found out it doesn't work. More protein is not better. I had more or less lost my taste for the two most important foods : vegetables and proteins, because of all the fruit I was eating.This book will never be outdated.

To quote an excerpt:\"On the outside of their front door Georgia and Bessi had written in chalk '26a', and on the inside 'G + B', at eye level, just above the handle. This was the extra dimension. The one after sight, sound, smell, touch and taste where the world multiplied and exploded because it was the sum of two people. Bright was twice as bright. All the colours were extra. Girls with umbrellas skipped across the wallpaper and Georgia and Bessi could hear them laughing.\"Georgia and Bessi are identical twins growing up in Neasden, London. Their mother is a Nigerian immigrant who pines after her homeland and converses with 'spirits' while their father, an English accountant, drowns his sorrows in the bottle. Despite these difficulties, Georgia and Bessi grow up as confident and imaginative girls, escaping in their own world of fantasy and possibility.What makes this novel so successful is the ultra-delicious writing, sprinkled with unusual linguistic devices and elements of 'magical realism'. Add to that animated, well-crafted characters and a story line that is hard to put down!Part hilarious, part endearing, part sobering, 26a is a moving ode to childhood, the pains of growing up and the magic of 'twinhood'.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"When I finished reading this book, I looked back and counted the dog ears I had made on a page whenever Eric made a point or statement that I thought I'd someday want to refer to.

The reader learns the origins of her unusual mannerisms and how and why her acting skills evolved. The book also traces her increasing assertiveness over the direction of her ultimately too-short film career.You don't have to have seen many of Marilyn's films to find this book entertaining.

It was invaluable. I went to a &quot;Top 10&quot; law school (not literally, but rather as the term is defined in the book) and found the cynical advice to be on point. Law school is a business. Administrations are more interested in attracting and keeping top professors (and in soliciting donations from wealthy\/influential alumni) than they are in ensuring their graduates will find fulfilling careers that also enable them to repay their crushing student loans. Planet Law School also accurately describes the socio-academic atmosphere at law schools - the contagious stress and anxiety, bordering on hysteria; the social stratification that occurs based upon class rank after first year grades are issued; the extreme difficulty those with mediocre or low grades have in obtaining respectable and well-paying employment through on-campus interviews. The book is less helpful (but still very enlightening) when it comes to its discussion on how to prepare for and do well in law school. I disagree with the author's theory that virtually any law student who follows his system and works hard will be able to excell in law school. I believe this is because, mistakenly, the author makes Black Letter Law and Thinking Like a Lawyer seem paramount. At least where I went to law school, these items were only half the battle. I had good friends who were in the top of my class and we often were enrolled in the same courses with the same professors. They consistently received top marks; mine were almost always mediocre. However, when comparing our final exam responses after the fact, it often turned out our responses were substantively identical (same points of law, same reasoning, same conclusions). The differences were our writing styles and the fact that my friends consistently delved into collateral issues that, while not responding to the &quot;call of the question,&quot; were apparently topics of interest for the professor. Sometimes, my friends' responses virtually ignored the call of the question and they still Am-Jur'ed the course. (By the time I realized this, First Year was over; my grades rose dramatically by the end of Second Year, but in fall of Third Year most employers were not looking to hire 3L's.) While the author of Planet Law School does allude to the importance knowing each professor's &quot;agenda,&quot; this crucial component of law school preparation should be more heavily emphasized in his book - even more so than &quot;Black Letter Law&quot; and &quot;Thinking Like a Lawyer.&quot; After all, at any reputable law school virtually every student will walk into final exams knowing Black Letter Law backwards and forwards. To distinguish yourself (and earn top grades) you have to also appeal to and work in (no matter how tangentially) the professor's pet topics of interest or areas of research. As a post-script, the author and the law schools share a similar failing: They both fail to warn students about &quot;insurance defense&quot; law firms, which require billable hours comparable to the &quot;Big Firms&quot; but offer half the pay, a fraction of the chance to specialize in a practice area, and none of the respect. (The &quot;clients&quot; of such firms, insurance companies, also tend to treat their counsel as the enemy and will begrudge every tenth of an hour billed for.) To the uninitiated 2L or 3L, these firms often appear almost indistinguishable from the &quot;Big Firms.&quot; Law students should be subtly warned to avoid insurance defense practice to the fullest extent they can, and instead seek government or boutique practice work in a speciality they enjoy so that they can eventually become well-respected practitioners in a field of specialty.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Even before I started the reading of \"Middlemarch\", I was really very happy with the quality of the pulication of this book.

The gem is a sacred Indian artefact that carries a curse, and it leaves a trail of confusion and ruin in its path. Only the virtuous are likely to survive it, and when young heiress Rachel Verinder is bequeathed the stone by an evil uncle, her love, reputation and marriage plans are immediately thrown upside down. And the theft proves equally fateful to the host of family relations, servants, friends and professional detectives who join in to help the reader solve this artfully constructed case.But Wilkie Collins's novel, written in the era of Dickens and George Eliot, is also a commentary on the time and mores. Five principal voices, of different social and intellectual standing, alternate as the narrator, each bringing its own colour, and this helps the book pick through such archetypes as the faithful old butler, the bigoted poor relation, and the pusillanimous cousin, as well as offer glimpses of contemporary attitudes to scientific enquiry, drugs, superstition, and the law. The dialogues are equally truthful. Indeed, The Moonstone is a pleasure to read, subtly written and constantly amusing. And importantly, it skirts the pitfalls of Victorian prejudice, whether social, religious or racial. This surprising book ranks alongside the better known 19th century classics and is not to be missed.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I've read every novel by Thomas Harris and this has to be the top one. If you have a pulse then the movie has been in your VCR or DVD player at one time or another. I must say if you rely solely on the movie you are missing some wonderful writing. Most people have seen the movie and it follows the plot of book, so I won't bore people with a long-winded review. The novel starts out with an eager student (Clarice Starling) being offered a chance to interview Hannibal Lector. The purpose is to extract information that can be used to catch a killer that is kidnapping and skinning young women. The interview turns interesting, and Hannibal has himself a new toy to play with: Clarice starling. The book is a step up from RED DRAGON, which is the first novel in the Hannibal series. Although a very good read, RED DRAGON'S killer can't compare to Buffalo Bill, and Hannibal is a charismatic character that breathes life into the pages. I missed his prescence in the previous novel, as RED DRAGON has small snippets of Hannibal Lector; which is why THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a step up being that the entire novel revolves around Hannibal.I've read many nonfiction books on serial killers and Thomas Harris has done his homework (Harris modeled Jack Crawford after John Douglas who has written several books about the monsters he's chased while in the FBI. MINDHUNTER is the top book if serial killers are your thing). If you want a glimpse into the mind of a killer, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is the book; it has to be one of the top thrillers of all time. I would highly recommend reading RED DRAGON first, and then THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS; it will give you some foundation in which to follow Hannibal Lector. Silence is an excellent read and I will read it again many times.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"&quot;The Awakening&quot; was excellent. I would recommend this novel to anyone.

People would have had a better idea of who Bilbo was. The worst part about the movies was they made him look like a silly little old man. But this is a classic story of a rather ordinary little creature reaching out to be extraordinary when the situation required it. It is a mistake to think of this as a story about a small group of thirteen dwarves, a wizard, and a hobbit out to fight a dragon merely to win back a treasure. This group is out to win back a lost kingdom. And it must be pointed that an elf kingdom and a kingdom of humans suffered from the fall of the dwarf kingdom as well. So it shouldn't be a surprise when a war breaks out because other people want a share of the treasure. This a bit lighter in tone than The Lord of the Rings, but it came twenty years earlier, and a lot happened to Tolkien in that time, including World War II.

Scott Fitzgerald was a true wordsmith. He knew how to use the english language, and in \"The Great Gatsby,\" he used it more skillfully than he ever had before. He was a painstaking writer who went over every sentence over and over again, and his exactness shows.That's not to say that the book is flawless--there are whole books that exist just to list the book's faults, especially in its chronology--but let's see YOU write a book this good. The book is streamlined and focused, in part due to Fitzgerald's time spent writing an unsuccessful script right beforehand. The structure of a script--in which every scene leads to the next, and every scene moves the story forward, and the whole thing is resolved in about ninety minutes or so--taught Fitzgerald immeasurable amounts about what this book didn't need to make it great, and about how to propel a story forward.The characters are memorable, the place and time (the jazz era) are vividly depicted, and the writing will surround and enfold you.Ignore that kids have to read this in high school--that it's almost a textbook to them. Just be glad it exists, and give it a read.

It took me about 3 hours to read the book over-to-cover, and I did not feel as if I skimmed over any major concepts.The book is written as a novel, in which a new highly effective CEO is placed in charge of an extremely dysfunctional silicon valley startup company. The CEO takes the executive team to a leadership retreat where she teaches them about teamwork and the five major dysfunctions of a team.The five major dysfunctions as stated by the book are:1) Absence of Trust2) Fear of Conflict3) Lack of Commitment4) Avoidance of Accountability5) Inattention to resultsAt first the team is very skeptical of the CEO, and generally feels that the entire retreats are a waste of time. Gradually the CEO wins over each member of the team, and over the course of the 'novel' (warning: spoiler), fires a team member and re-organizes the executive team to better match the needs of the organization.Ok, now for my criticisms of the book...My first criticism - this reads like a cheezy TBS movie, where a new woman CEO wins over her team with compassion and competence. I have nothing against the general message of the author's novel, but in real life, people simply don't open up as personally as they do in this novel. The entire 'case study' feels canned and artificial.For example, when Kathryn, the new CEO takes over the company, the former CEO, Jeff, goes to a VP of Biz Development role. By the end of the book, he's so committed to the teamwork mentality that he voluntarily demotes himself, so that he is no longer an executive level staff member, and he reports to the COO as director of Biz Development.... I worked in a number of different companies and frankly, this would *never* happen. No self-respecting CEO would demote themselves two levels for the sake of teamwork...In another scene, Kathryn fires the VP of marketing. This added some credibility to the book, but there was quite a bit of writing focusing on the dialogue and thoughts of the characters in a dramatic fashion. Personally, I found this type of writing distracting. While at some level, many working in middle management might be able to relate to this kind of event, personally I don't need the 'entertainment factor' of dramatic dialogue and canned thoughts and would prefer that the author focused on providing criteria by which to judge if team members are willing to work within his framework or not (which was not presented by the way).My second criticism - I could forgive the novel style writing, but my second major issue with the book is that I question its core message of teamwork.Yes, you heard me correctly, I have no idea how the author developed his so-called pyramid of teamwork, whether its based on empirical data, or just his personal observations from consulting. While the 5 dysfunctions certainly sound important, perhaps only 1 or 2 (i.e. trust, fear of conflict) of them are truly of strategic importance to teamwork, and the other 3 relate to personal management style of leaders (i.e. inattention of results). Frankly, I'm not sure how well thought out the pyramid is at all.The worst part is, everything in the book is fiction.... so it's no wonder that the CEO, Kathryn, is able to turn around the company as soon as her executive team embraces the great pyramid of truth... again cheezy TBS movie material.At the time that I purchased this book, I also purchased two other books on leadership... one of the others is a book that I'd highly recommend to anyone interested in the subject, and that is - 'Lincoln on Leadership.' The book details Abraham Lincoln's ability to lead the Union to victory during the Civil War, and specifically focuses on his management style through a fairly meticulous reading of letters, speeches, and historical records.Lincoln is a great case study, because first everything that happened is REAL, and second he was dealt an almost impossible hand of cards. He initially was elected to president with a minority of the national vote (plurality of several candidates), people felt at the time that he was a 'second-rate country lawyer' and had little faith in his ability to solve seemingly intractable problems between the North and South, numerous politicians attempted to undermine his executive authority related to the war effort or diplomacy with the South, former generals and members of his own cabinet even ran against him as a presidential candidate either in the first election or his second re-election.I read the Lincoln book immediately before reading Lencioni's Five Dysfunctions, and what struck me was that Lincoln's team probably violated almost every rule in Lencioni's book. In short, he probably had one of the most dysfunctional teams imaginable, and yet is widely regarded by historians as the greatest among US Presidents and leaders.While I think teamwork is important, I'm not certain that Lencioni's Five Dysfunctions, really captures the essence of aligning people to achieve a particular objective, nor am I certain how well thought out the pyramid of teamwork is.I'm surprised by how highly rated this book is. I guess it's easy to read - 3 hours tops, has some entertainment value so it doesn't feel like work, and you may have the illusion that you learned something from reading it, but I'm very much a skeptic.So far the best leadership book I've come across is Lincoln on Leadership, and having read it, I'm intrigued enough to follow up with Goodwin's Team of Rivals in the near future.","sentiment_score":0.4},{"review":"This is my all time favortie book.

Since the incident he was sent to his aunti and uncles house to be raised (the Dusleys). When he grows older he finds out that he is actually a wizard and gets sent to a wizarding school named Hogwarts. He goes to Diagon Alley to buy school supplies and what knot. At Hogwarts he meets two very nice friends, Ron and Hermione. All three of them goes to Gryffindor, which is one of the four houses at Hogwarts to be schooled. During the school year he finds out that he is very good at quidditch (a wizard sports game) and becomes their team seeker (a position in the game). But evil strikes soon and Lord Voldemort is behind it all. Harry finds out that he is trying to steal the Sorceror's Stone, which is believed to give you eternal life. So he sets out to stop him from stealing it with his trusted friends. In this fun filled book you will expierence drama, action,and humor in every corner.

I just thought that this novel would be a good example of Americans' perspective towards Japan, which is always good to know. Although this book once was (and still is?) one of the bestsellers in the US, and the book's universal message regarding peace and love was good to read, this was the first English book that I have ever got so disappointed. To me Japanese, situations and Japanese characters felt too unnatural. On the one hand the Japanese characters were depicted so overly &quot;Japanese&quot; that they often bowed just unnecessarily, and on the other hand their attitudes and behaviors were unbelievably so westernized. The real Japanese living in Japan almost in their lifetime could not easily act like that simply as a result of staying in the US for just a couple of months. I know I myself is a good example. I stayed in the US for 6 months before. I wish I could evaluate this novel as a nice try. A plethora of &quot;tiny&quot; failures just disabled me to do so.","sentiment_score":0.4},{"review":"THE MOONSTONE opens with the theft of a fabulous jewel from an idol in India. From this exotic location the action then goes forward in time many years to the English countryside. The jewel, the Moonstone, has become a family heirloom soon to be presented to a young woman as a birthday present. That very evening the Moonstone disappeared leaving behind suspicion and tragedy. A professional detective is called in but before all is revealed there will be deaths and long hidden secrets brought to light.The story was originally published in the mid 1800's which can cause a problem for a modern reader. The style of writing is much more verbose than contemporary readers are accustomed to, the vocabulary is often unfamiliar but perhaps most difficult for the modern reader are the conventions of mid Victorian society. The class distinctions and the restrictions placed on women, particularly young, unmarried women are completely foreign to the 21st century.Despite these challenges THE MOONSTONE is an excellent story on its own merits. The characters are interesting and believeable. The plot is well thought out, full of twists and turns that will keep the reader guessing until the very end. For fans of detective fiction it is interesting to see the various elements of this story and recognize them from their more modern forms.THE MOONSTONE has been called the first detective novel. It introduced many of the characteristics familiar to fans of this genre, the outsider, professional detective, the bumbling, incompetant local police, the clueless sidekick, the red herring clues that lead the reader astray and the premise that all clues must be available for the reader to solve the crime. In that regard THE MOONSTONE has its own unique place in history no matter what the quality of the story itself might be.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"An excellent adventure with all the thrills of war, treasure hunts, magic and long~lasting friendships forged by despair in battle and victory unexpected.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I don't normally write reviews on here, but I thought that the last one was a little too harsh.

Jean M. Auel's \"THE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR\" tells the story of the dawn of mankind according to Darwin's evolutionary theories whereby the soon-to-be-extinct Neanderthals are about to be overwhelmed by the more adaptable\/environmentally and genetically superior Cro-Magnon. After an earthquake kills her family, young five-year-old Ayla is forced to fend for herself until she is found by the Clan Of The Cave Bear which is led by the stoic yet good-hearted leader, Brun: they are a Neanderthal tribe and she is of Cro-Magnon descent. Once Brun decides to accept Ayla as part of his own Clan (in spite of their differences), Auel's tale becomes a neat character study coupled with an in-depth, day-to-day depiction of what primitive life may have been like all those years ago. Her prodigious research and the painstaking re-creation of the spiritual, physical, and mental aspects of a Neanderthal tribe is quite breathtaking in its believability and its humanity. As such it is THIS portion of the book which deserves the most praise. However, as a whole \"THE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR\" has not aged well. Auel is an above-average writer, but the construction of the book is woefully patchy and badly in need of a good editor. Events are, at times, leisurely paced yet routinely interrupted by drastic plot twists interspersed with treatises on plants and medicinal herbs, hunting, knapping tools, clothes making, food preparation and preservation as well as the meticulous cataloging of ceremonies, rituals, and feasts that are a part of their tradition. The detail is exhausting: yet none of these elements are allowed to blend into the narrative in a cohesive way. Add to that Auel's intrusively modern, feminist point of view (i.e. the promotion of abortion, euthanasia, contraception, etc.) that tends to creep into the storyline; and the resulting equilibrium of the book seems completely off-kilter and at odds with the basic plot. People of the Judeo\/Christian faith will also have problems with the Darwinian point-of-view (although Auel does a great job in conveying the seriousness of the clan's beliefs by alluding to their cave bear ceremony as a sacrament equivalent to the communion of bread and wine in honor of Christ's death and resurrection unto glory). However, I find it intriguing that the \"spiritual element\" of such primitive people even exists if (as Darwinists proclaim) we simply crawled out of a primordial soup and evolved from monkeys. Since we are, supposedly, the result of a vast cosmic accident: then, by default, religion and the spiritual aspect of man should not exist or even be part of our genetic capabilities. Yet the capabilities are there in spite of all the scientific \"evidence\" to the contrary. Interesting. Still, the book is enjoyable, the main characters well-drawn, and the overall story compelling. For popular fiction that is a major achievement, but as a contemporary classic it misses the mark by a wider margin.","sentiment_score":0.6},{"review":"This is a great book for someone who is clueless or simply wants to review.

It then covers the history from the point of view of the czarists and the communists. It touches on major historical figures, and gives a lay down of what social conditions were like immediately prior to the revolutions both of 1905 and 1917. It stops in mid-1917, and so doesn't cover the civil war. The author determined that this rich history laid outside the scope of what he intended to describe.This is a good though perhaps dated general history. It would be good as an introductory for students looking to learn more about the time period, though there is more recent scholarship out there.

Mother Bear says goodnight to each of her cubs and suggests what she thinks each of them will dream about.Kerry Argent has beautifully illustrated the bears so that they look fuzzy enough to touch. The textured artwork of the \"real\" world is different from that of the dreams. The scenery and objects illustrated in the bear cubs' dreams is flatter looking, with little shading or color gradient.Argent has included a blue stuffed elephant in each non-dream illustration. It is on the title page, and then is held by one or another of the bear cubs throughout the book until the final page. Once everyone has fallen asleep, the stuffed elephant blows out the candle.

The nineteen stories were written over a period of thirty years and published in 1954. All of the tales are 'small' stories and some are half a page and others in the twenties, but each is perfectly plotted and seems to 'glide' as you read them.How do I explain 'glide', you have to read one of the stories to understand, but it's like watching \"Tinkerbelle\" in \"Peter Pan\"; it gives you a sense of tranquility that you can't express in words. Two stories especially affected me, \"The Basement\" and \"The Children's Campaign\"\"The Basement\" is about a man who has to drag his useless legs behind him to get to the spot where he begs everyday. A man who sees him almost everyday gets into a conversation with him and ends up following him home. The strength of the story is the conviction of the \"cripple\" that he has a 'good life' and doesn't see himself as a 'disabled' person. The serenity of the man who has come to 'grips' with his place in life is worth the whole book.\"The Children's Campaign\" is a anti-war polemic that is truly a masterpiece. In a far off country, children under fourteen make up the armed forces and protect the country. When they are called on to attack a 'neighbor' they go about it with a fanaticism that no adult could. Much of the story is reads like an accusation against the \"Old General\" who sent youth off to die during WWI without ever having visited the battlefields. (During Vietnam we used to say, \"Old soldiers never die; young ones do\".)

In the latter case, only the remarks about \"Background\" and \"Contents\" apply. In particular, the remarks about photographic quality do not apply to earlier editions.BACKGROUNDBorn and raised in Wisconsin and trained as a cultural anthropologist, David George devoted himself for many years to the culture of Andalusia and particularly of the Gypsies; and the present volume was for many years one of the few authoritative books available in English. Like its contemporaries,The Art of Flamenco,The Wind CriedandThe Flamencos of Cadiz Bay, it is unlikely to be rivalled or superseded by any new account, for the way of life it documents is fast vanishing, indeed has already vanished in many places.According to the note at the beginning, David George (or, if applicable, his estate) has disappeared from view; so if you have any information, please contact the publishers:Bold Strummer110C Imperial AvenueWestport, CT 06880-2037CONTENTSThere is a good deal of interesting information on the Gypsies, their history and their music, much of it narrated in apparently verbatim transcriptions of conversations. Mr George is a gifted writer, and his accounts are full of life and atmosphere. Likewise, there is much about the history and construction of the flamenco guitar (although this is not a manual).But the centrepieces, if you will, of this book are two interviews: with the luthier Manuel Reyes &mdash; one of the truly great constructors of guitars &mdash; and with the now-legendary guitarist Diego del Gastor. I found them fascinating, even though I've already read a great deal about both men. Particularly entertaining are Diego's views on the hoards of students arriving in Mor&oacute;n every year for lessons.Much of the most interesting information in the book is in the end-notes, which compose fully 38 of its 131 pages. This makes for rather awkward reading, but it's worth it.PRESENTATIONThis, the 4th printing, is a reproduction of the original of 1969. I have to say that the quality of the reproduction is not good, being about equivalent to that of a fax. The technical quality of the photographs is even worse &mdash; not even as good as one could find in an average newspaper.The economics of republishing a book such as this &mdash; for what must surely be a relatively small market &mdash; are outside my area of competence. But if Mr George is unavailable, so too (presumably) are the originals of his photographs, and one must do one's best with what remains. Certainly it would be a pity to let a fine book such as this go out of print, and I recommend it despite its reproductive shortcomings.DISCLOSUREI received a free copy of this item for review.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Dated (1980's) so don't expect a lot of current technology for this ancient craft.

This article was published in the January 2003-issue of Harvard Business Review.We all know or aware of them, people that do not do what you want. Nicholson believes you cannot motivate these problem people: \"Only they themselves can.\" So what does that mean for their managers? They need \"to create the circumstances in which their inherent motivation (natural commitment and drive) is freed and channeled toward achievable goals.\" The author introduces a method that involves shifting the responsibility for motivation from subject to object, from boss to subordinate. This method is based on a handful principles: Everyone has motivational energy; this energy is often blocked in the workplace; and removing blockages requires employee participation. The author supplements this with seven typical hazards in handling problem people. By using several examples, the author introduces a three-step process for a solution or resolution: (1) Create a rich picture, which means getting as much information as you can from as many sources as possible. (2) Reframe your goals, based on your (revised) picture you should set achievable and realistic goals for your problem employee. (3) Stage the encounter, which should consist of an affirmative assertion, leverage questioning, and the 'moment of truth'. The author believes that this method will at least lead to a resolution, if not solution, for dealing with problem people issues.Nice article on a difficult management issue. The three-step process is largely build on an emotional approach: trying to understand the problem employee, then trying to create circumstances so that this problem employee is able to motivate himself. The author is realistic enough to state that his method is not perfect, but I believe that the strongest point of this method (especially in the current knowledge-economy) is that it signals that the organization\/manager not just deals with difficult people but is also humane in their approach.

God's providence enables Valjaen to do good unto others in atonement for his past transgressions.Overall, I enjoyed the story and example the author set throughout the book in doing good deeds to help others. The Bible says, \"...all things work together for good to those who love God\", and I enjoyed seeing how things ultimately worked out. In some cases, the result may not have been what a person desired in his or her own life, but God can and does work through us to accomplish His will. This is evident in life and in Victor Hugo's story.Reading this book requires a good amount of patience as Victor Hugo diverges into lengthy examinations of various topics (e.g., the Battle of Waterloo, the history of the Paris sewer system, etc.). He ultimately has a reason for these long discourses, but the pay-off is quite small for your investment of time. These sections do help the reader to understand the times and setting of the story, but I felt they were overly drawn out. I can see how many readers would give up on the book after trudging through pages of seemingly meaningless information.I chose the Norman Denny translation, which is slightly abridged at 1,232 pages compared to Lee Fahnestock's translation at 1,484 pages. I should note, the missing content is placed into appendices if you really want to get the full experience. Denny opted to abridge several sections where he felt Hugo ran too long and readers would not miss anything by skipping ahead in the story.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"A new novel by Clive Cussler? Well then, I knew right where to look - the fiction section! Did I find it there? You bet! Was I disappointed by some less-than-perfect grammar and techno-isms? No way! You see, I read Cussler (along with Clancy, King, and others) for the sheer joy of escape. Yes, the characters and plot are all too familiar but this is precisely the reason I am drawn back to them, novel after novel (much like slipping into a pair of old favorite jeans). I have become used to the Cussler conventions (such as starting a story in the pre-historic, continuing another thread in the historic, and drawing them altogether in the present) and, quite simply, I like it - it works!Atlantis Found pulls together such diverse story lines (a comet, world-wide devastation, an old sailing vessel, Nazis, ice-caps, etc.) and weaves them into a wonderful escapist tapestry. To the vast majority of other readers out there I say, grab a copy of any Cussler material, sit back, and let the real world spin without you for a few fun-filled hours!","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I've used this book so many times, the cover is almost worn away and the pages are covered in flour.

On the surface, this is a simplistic story and a rather short one at 200 pages. What is brilliant about this book, however, is Golding's ability to craft a powerful and timeless statement about humanity and mankind. His prose is concise and focused, yet his ability to paint a picture of castaway life on a tropical island is every bit as good as much longer tomes. I found the breakdown of civilized values played out on a beautiful tropical island to be a terrific dichotomy. The interplay between the English school boys and the brutal reality of survival on an island provided numerous intersections in a brilliantly interwoven plot. The end result is a rather haunting reminiscence of this story after you've finished reading it. This is similar to Robinson Crusoe or The Count of Monte Cristo in that they are all stories we know. Yet, going back and reading them again as an adult brings new worlds of meaning and perspective along with perhaps a new-found appreciation for why they are timeless stories to begin with.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This fictional work is as fine a book as any non fiction book covering the period leading up to Churchill's ascension to Prime Minister.

A great read that gives wonderful insight into the mess inherited by Churchill from Chamberlain and his ilk.

Here, the navies built for such an unimaginable conflict now stalk each other, and although the book focuses on the British and German parts of the war it still is valuable for those interested in history or in vivid historical writing. Particularly valuable are the little-known but critical clashes outside Europe, notably the battles off Chile and Argentina that aren't well-remembered today -- Coronel and the Falklands -- but which were important at the time. (Indeed, Coronel was the first fleet action that Britain had lost in a century). Indeed, the end result of the naval war was the victory that the stalemated land war never achieved: the siege-by-sea that threatened both Britain and Germany with starvation, the latter breaking first, a collapse signaled by the German navy's revolt. The book does not neglect an important postscript: the post-war scuttling of the German fleet at the British naval base at Scapa Flow.Very worthwhile.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This is technically the first in the Bernard Cornwell Sharpe series, and because of that, the first I read based on a timeline I saw on Mr. Cornwell's site. Granted, I started this series because I'd seen the Sharpe movies with Sean Bean, but don't let that detract from a wonderful story. Sharpe's Eagle is a fascinating story of the Napoleonic Wars (The Peninsular Wars) one rarely hears about. The detail of the battle, the battalion inner-workings, firearms of the day, and landscape were enough to keep me interest throughout the story.As for Richard Sharpe, I found him to be a hard character, willing to do anything to get the job done (soldiering, the only thing he knows) but an honorable man, too. He fights for what he believes in as much as for what his commanding officers tell him to. Brought up from the ranks, a near impossibility in the British army at the time, Sharpe is far from what other officers consider a gentleman, and yet comports himself much more gentlemanly than they. It's part of his charm as well as what often gets him into trouble.In the Historical Note, Mr. Cornwell mentions what really happened at Talavera, yet despite that, and the liberties he took with history, instead of being indignant, I'm far more curious. I'd usually toss this book against the wall and never read another in the series, yet the writing and story intrigue me to read more.The supporting characters are equally well drawn, especially SGT. Harper, who follows Sharpe throughout the series. I look forward to reading more of their exploits.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading KNOTS AND CROSSES, which, as I mentioned in the title above, is the first Inspector Rebus novel I've read. Rankin's hero is very down to earth: deeply flawed, introspective, self-destructive (Rebus drinks a lot of booze and smokes a lot of cigarettes), guilt-ridden, in other words, my kind of cop. In this debut novel by Ian Rankin, John Rebus is a DS, Detective Sergeant with the Edinborough, Scotland PD, and not yet the Detective Inspector he will become in subsequent books in the series, and feeling misused by his superiors. He's frequently given low level, plodding through data kinds of jobs on the cases he is assigned. For example:\"Chief Inspector Anderson was in charge. Anderson was doling out tasks. Rebus reminded himself to stop praying. Perhaps if he stopped praying, God would stop being such a bastard to one of his few believers on this near-godforsaken planet.'Gemmill and Hartley will be assigned to door-to-door..'Well, thank God he'd not been landed with that one. There was only one thing worse than door-to-door...'And for an initial check on the M.O. files, Detective Sergeants Morton and Rebus.'...and that was it.\"There's a serial killer loose in the city, snatching and then strangling pre-teenage girls, and pressure is being put on the EPD to find him fast. The Press is demanding something be done and scaring the bejeezus out of mothers and fathers in the city with banner headlines like EDINBOROUGH ABDUCTIONS-NOW IT'S MURDER!Because DS Rebus is a good policeman he has his own way of doing things, which is why he is given the worst jobs by superiors who don't like to be disobeyed, especially when Rebus feels that they are headed in the wrong direction. He also suffers from terrible nightmares about his previous Army experience after leaving the Paras to join the elite SAS (British Special Forces) which impact negatively on his relationships with women. These and other factors make Rebus a very interesting and, to me, a likeable character...warts and all.There is a reason why this book's title is KNOTS AND CROSSES. There's a connection between this title and the game of Noughts and Crosses (O's and X's), British for tic-tac-toe, and the killer who ties just one knot in each of the ropes he uses to strangle his young victims.The reason why I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because I was a little let down at the climax. It seemed to me that the author could have done a better job of it. I think he rushed to get an otherwise exciting police procedural done and off to his publisher. I'll still give Rebus a chance and will pick up the next book in the series, HIDE AND SEEK.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I have read through this series to this point.

All things are subject to His (God's) immediate control: all things are moving in accord with His eternal purpose, and therefore, all things are working toether for good to them that love God, to them who are called according to His purpose.&quot;Rev. Pink himself knew that &quot;It would be foolish for us to expect that this work will meet with general approval.&quot; He saw the trend in modern Christendom (so-called) as being toward the &quot;deification of the creature rather than the glorification of the Creator.&quot;This book presents a relentless defining of not only the sovereignty of God, but also His sovereignty in Creation, Administration, Salvation, Reprobation, and in Prayer, to name a few. Arthur Pink exposes the modern gospel as a weak, apostate faith that has &quot;relagt(ed) God to the background.&quot;After reading this book, the Bible will become a new book to you.

It's definitely Gaiman's deliberate and very successful attempt to bring comedy to his storytelling gift of rustling up the reader's imagination. Before everything, I have to say the part that made me laugh out loud was the part deep in the story where Daisy was expressing her dread of her job, much like a particular movie character (many of you can relate to this already, can't you?).The images the 1st chapter brings to mind are nothing short of an adult-like look at a Saturday-morning cartoon! And, that's just setting up the \"real story\" that the rest of the book tells.The premise of a family member who comes into the main character's life and just WON'T go back home is a situation with which many people can relate, much to their own chagrins, and that is what happens here. But, this particular family member has a very special talent and he uses it to impose on his brother's life...!The sub-plots are kept to a minimum, unlike in Gaiman's \"Neverwhere\" [yet, that is a very good book]!The interesting thing about \"Anansi Boys\" is that Gaiman reverently \"nods\" to the ART of storytelling in the African and African-American traditions; in somewhat the same way as he did in \"American Gods\", he puts in short stories of that genre at the end of certain chapters, but [thankfully] not as many.Gaiman also respectfully nods to the ART of song and singing, which is very interesting and, I would imagine, challenging and he arose to the challenge very well: I mean, have you ever read a book where the narrator described a song as it is being sung? Plus, at a few more points throughout the story, especially at the end, Gaiman expresses just how special songs are; that's a really nice touch!As you read Gaiman's books, you find that the main character, at some point deep in the story, must go through a major rite of passage, that death doesn't necessarily mean \"dead and gone\" and that YOU WILL get a full-length, real-life history lesson late in the story; perhaps this is Gaiman's means of re-establishing the balance of FACT and REALITY to all the IMAGINATION and FANTASY that he has stirred up in the readers' minds; my favorite `lesson' of his is in \"American Gods\" (it's about Lookout Mountain). Gaiman also makes it evident that he loves to EAT! In this and in \"Neverwhere\", he has major scenes that describe the food being eaten at a certain meal, and the tastes, smells and the sounds and how much the characters enjoy their meals!If you like chuckling while you read, you must read \"Anansi Boys\"; and then watch out for a 7-legged spider :o ...","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"c'mon-this is at least an eleven...I found this book in my grandparents basement, copywrite -like, 1920 or something.

Born to parents who were too young, wild and restless to be good caregivers, he was thrust into foster home, where abuse and neglect were more the rule than the exception. It was all but inevitable that he would grow up seething with rage and a thirst for revenge. Mackenzie's Southie upbringing brought him into contact with the kill-or-be-killed mentality that propelled him toward brawling and martial arts -- used for self-protection as well as for unleashing his inner demons -- then into crime and drugs and finally into the icy grip of killer Whitey Bulger.Mackenzie's story is fascinating and horrifying. Every page brims over with tales of fights, beatings, narrow escapes and strategic surrenders. The picture Mackenzie paints of the hyper-tough poverty-stricken neighborhoods of Southie are repulsively fascinating. The nuances and subtleties of the code of \"honor\" -- rat to save your skin, but never on your friends -- is worthy of a Shakespearean plot.Mackenzie's story overlaps with that of the MacDonald family, unforgettably penned by Michael Patrick MacDonald in \"All Souls.\" No surprise: Mackenzie and the MacDonalds were pals during the same volatile period. In fact, readers of both books will recognize a few of the same incidents. But while MacDonald's family was decimated by the drugs and violence Bulger brought to the neighborhood, Mackenzie thrived -- selling drugs, doing enforcement duty for Whitey and reaping the rewards (booze, girls and respect) that flowed from his ties to the mobster.\"Street Soldier\" is a quick, exciting and full of violent action. Sometimes, it seems that \"Eddie Mack\" revels too much, even in hindsight, in the mayhem he created. The almost sexual pleasure he gets from feeling a bone break under his hands is disturbing. For those with lesser reservoirs of hatred and rage than the author, we will be glad we were not born into his cauldron of barely civilized violence. Mackenzie's book is also an act of courage. He names many, many names and ties Bulger and his associates to innumerable murders, tortures and drug deals. His motive, as the reader will quickly discover, is revenge over the discovery that Bulger, the ultimate enforcer of the neighborhood code of silence, himself broke it repeatedly to save his own skin.Mackenzie is a tough and scary guy, though with a soft side. He dearly loves his daughters and tries hard to elevate himself from his hoodlum past. His book is at once a memoir of a life gone terribly awry, a documentary of the criminal behavior (his own and others) that afflicted Southie in the last 30 years, and an indictment of the authorities, notably the FBI, that for their own reasons allowed the killing, drugging and violence to continue without letup. An honest, eye-opening and disturbing book.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Jeffrey Taylor's book Facing the Congo gives an insight into the former-Zaire, as well as a brief view of Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo. His book contributes immensely to an outsider's inside view of Zaire and how a leader by the name of Mobutu Sese Seko, along with western support, de-moralized and contributed to the present state-of-affairs in the newly renamed DRC. Jeffrey Tayler's cautious and realistic approach to the region does justice to the task that was at hand. Neither does Tayler make stereotypical assumptions, nor does he grossly inflate his story, he tells the situation as it was, and is.For people who are interested in the Central Africa region, this book is highly recommended as a nice travelogue written by a mondele who sought to travel the River Congo and document his experiences. As someone who has traveled throughout this region, I can personally say that I have had similar experiences as Jeffrey Tayler has had.For those who consider themselves 'travelogue-junkies,' this book will be a nice addition to your collection(s)and imagination(s).

Very little was written about her while she was alive that was worth reading. Many people believed she was an empty-headed, spoilt girl with a privileged upbringing, who went mad. But that isn't true. Most people only knew her as the woman on the front of every magazine in the world. Everyone was shocked to the core when she died, but surely that shared shock doesn't make sense if she was so insubstantial!This book fills in the missing pieces. It tells us things we never knew about Diana. It is not gossip, but fact, heard first-hand from some of Diana's closest friends and confidantes.We all knew, subconsciously, that Diana was more than just a face. In fact she was an amazing woman. Not many people could have survived the pressures she had to cope with and emerged as a stronger person with the ability to shake the world's governments. Nobody has ever looked for what inspired this great change in Diana. The answer is that she had at last found a man she wanted to marry; a man who inspired her in her quest to help the sick and suffering. He was a heart surgeon; she called him 'Mr Wonderful'. She took her love for him to her grave.Diana:Her last Love tells for the first time the complete story of Diana's love for Dr Hasnat Khan. It explains where Dodi fitted into the picture (she was certainly not in love with Dodi); how she and Prince Charles became great friends towards the end of her life, and how she came to terms with Camilla.It is a sad story, but also heart-warming, in that it makes you appreciate for the first time just how special this woman was.Unusually for a biography, this is a very easy book to read. I read it at one sitting. Although it is debatable whether anything else should be written about Diana, I believe that this book is fully justified; it sets history to rights, and above all I suspect Diana would have approved of it herself - it would certainly appear that some of her closest friends encouraged the author to write the book, which seems to be accompanied by a forthcoming TV documentary.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Joy Fielding is one of the authors that I buy a book just by the author name alone. This book was not her best but still wasn't a waste of time. The plot was interesting. The angry daughter comes home because her estranged mother shoots and kills a complete stranger. The plot is interesting but not the sit on the edge of your seat suspense that is the norm in books by Joy Fielding. The ending was definitely a surprise so you can't call the book predictable.

It's short, only 200ish pages long - but don't let the short length of it deceive you, it packs a fairly powerful punch.The premise fascinated me from the moment I read it. Innocent young man who manages to remain that way on the outside, but a portrait of him changes to reflect the corruption of his soul. Fascinating, no?I'm positive that this book has been dissected and analyzed from all sorts of different points of view, so let me tell you what I got out of it.I felt the tragedy, deeply. The corruption of a soul is something that is unpleasant to read, unpleasant to see and seeing the effect it has on others is difficult to deal with at times.It's interesting because I read this novel while I am still continuing to work my way through George Eliot's Middlemarch. Whereas I am having such a difficult time relating to and feeling emotions from Eliot's characters, there was such a wealth of emotion being poured out of Wilde's it was almost overwhelming. I felt the passion of love and the despair when it was lost.By the way dialogue was incredible, it makes the book, honestly. I highly recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it. And if you haven't read it in a while, go back and read it now. It's going on my \"yearly re-read\" shelf for certain.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This is a great book.

It seems that Dawkin's use of metaphors in the bulk of the book, could make it harder to understand the science behind his logic. However, this is not the case because Dawkins is very careful about which metaphors he uses. These metaphors prevent people with a vast knowledge of genetics from getting board while reading the book, but at the same time teach people about genetics without them realizing it. The science behind this book is very solid. Throughout most of the books he cites papers and other scientists. Dawkins is also an accomplished zoologist and a professor at Oxford. Dawkins is obviously an atheist and he is not afraid to express his opinions at the expense of others beliefs. In the endnotes there is a section spent entirely on proving religions wrong.In the book Richard Dawkins makes the argument that genes, not humans, are selfish. He says that this is the only way possible because genes are constantly competing for a `spot' in organisms. If genes were altruistic then they would not be as likely to get passed onto future generations as those that are selfish because the selfish ones would reap the benefits while the altruistic genes would suffer. This means that at some point altruistic genes became essentially nonexistent in the gene pool.His selfish gene logic means that genes that cause selfish phenotypes are the only genes in organisms. This means that all organisms, without conscious thought, will only do things that they gain from (by gaining he means having a higher chance of passing on their genes). He gives examples of seemingly altruistic relationships, like the aphid to ant relationship. Then he shows that they are actually for selfish gain and it just so happens that along with the gain for the individual comes gain for the other.At the end of the book Dawkins shows that having selfish genes could actually result in a `nice' organism in the chapter \"Nice guys finish first.\" He uses Prisoner's Dilemma, a game, to describe how this could happen. In the end he shows that strategies that play kindly end up getting a higher number of points then those that play meanly. (Strategies are like genes they set up a rule for playing, but do not consciously control the organism\/game). This means that to gain selfishly you would actually want to be nice. So niceness could occur in a selfish gene pool.Dawkins also says that humans have a conscious and are one of the first organisms that can act independently from their selfish genes in thought and action.In summary, I thoroughly enjoyed this book because of its scientific teachings and sound logic. Therefore, I would recommend it to everyone.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Christopher Moore's story of one particular Christmas in small town California is hilarious.

It is the story of Elizabeth White, a shy young 10-year-old English girl, who is sent to her mother's school chum in Ireland in order to keep her from the dangers of World War II. The Irish O'Connors are the direct opposite of the English Whites. Whereas Elizabeth is an only child, her chum and counterpart Aisling shares the house with a rollicking set of brothers and sisters. Elizabeth's parents are formal and strangely aloof, while Aisling's are loud, demonstrative and loving. At the end of the war, Elizabeth returns to her cold parents, but she keeps up a correspondance with Aisling. As they grow up, the young women endure unhappy love affairs, illness in their families, and unfulfilled dreams, yet they are always free to confide in and support one another. Binchy describes life in a rollicking Irish family with loving detail and creates characters which the reader grows to love. The other side to that is the Irish melancholy which is also an important part of her writing, so the reader needs to be prepared for both.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"This book is challenging in two main ways.1) It challenges the dominant worldview about the nature of material and energetic exchange enabled by the global economy, and the role of modern free markets and industrialization in perpetuating and worsening global historical inequalities.Both the global benefactors (in centers) and the direct victims (in peripheries) of this process are blind to its true nature because our historical frame of discourse about exchange obscures the realities of global resource \"exchange\"--a word which in itself presumes an equal trade of tit for tat. In this sense, we are all victims of \"the machine\"--The Matrix style--where people in global peripheries (from where high-quality resources are extracted) as subjected to exploitation at the hands hands of people in global centers (to where the resources go).Hornborg uses the machine as a means of examining and critiquing industrialization as a process of converting high quality matter\/energy into low-quality, but high-priced products. Because these are high-entropy products, they require much more material\/energetic inputs in order to operate and sustain them. Thus, they require \"feeding,\" and that is the purpose of peole in global centers. Like that quote from \"Fight Club\"--\"The things you own end up owning you.\" In a sense, \"machines\" take on a life of their own as they have power over us and we literally worship them as inherently \"productive.\"I don't think Hornborg is a luddite--technology isn't inherently evil. It is more a problem of concentration and distribution. However, unless we reach an enlightened position about the true nature of industrialization and global resource transfer, machines will continue to own us, and may push us toward the brink of self-destruction.2) The book also challenges the reader. Hornborg makes the excuse early on that it is inherently challenging because it aims to construct a whole new worldview to replace the reader's current worldview. This is partially true. However the book is also challenging because how, and for whom, it is written. It is NOT an easy read. It is fairly non-linear, uses many terms that will be obscure to anyone outside of the many fields from which Hornborg draws. He doesn't include a glossary or define many of the technical words he uses, which is a big no no IMO. So keep a dictionary close by. Be patient and be prepared to work hard to extract meaning from what he writes--it is often like piecing together a puzzle where no single part makes much sense until you can gain a sense of the total image. In the end, I think the struggle is worth it--it is actually a very intuitive and even visual argument. I can see an animated diagram in my head that embodies his argument.But I also think he COULD have written it to be more accessible--there are many sentences that could easily be unpacked. Overall, it might have made the book 100 pages longer, but overall a much smoother read.I hope his argument gains steam and more people start writing in this vein (albeit more accessibly). The implications are vast, especially among all the trendy and often-meaningless talk about \"sustainability.\"","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"The author, Lise Pyles, and I have known each other most of our lives. We were best friends in elementary school and lived just across the street from each other. Interestingly, we both had children diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome, which kind of makes me wonder about whether environmental factors might contribute to the rise of this condition, since we both drank the same water growing up.Lise and I lost touch throughout much of our adult lives, but when we reconnected some years ago, she was a wonderful source of support to me while I was homeschooling my daughter. (My kid is the one in the book who loved mules, when all the other little girls were into horses.) Every time I would email Lise, wondering whether I was doing the right thing or if I was on the right track, Lise would write back with positive observations that I had not been able to make myself. That's because I was in the thick of it--the everyday challenges of homeschooling made it hard for me to step back and make observations about the overall progress that was happening.What I loved about Lise's book when it was later published is that it was just like the actual conversations we'd had, by email and in person, about homeschooling an Aspy. She is a practical, down-to-earth person who can wisely see how Asperger kids are able to flourish when they're taught at home, without the distractions, transitions, and other challenges that occur at school.I'm happy to report that after about five years of homeschooling, my daughter was able to handle the social challenges of attending a private alternative school. The years when we home schooled prepared her for going out into the larger world. In her school, where they practice democratic decision-making and where students initiate their own learning experiences, my daughter has continued to grow socially. As with many Asperger kids, we never had to worry about my daughter's academic abilities, but we did wonder if she would be able to stand being in a room full of other people, and now she can do that and fully participate in school meetings. She has important jobs at school and at home, and we don't really worry about whether she'll be able to function as a working adult in a few years.Lise's earlier book, \"Hitchhiking Through Asperger Syndrome,\" also helped prepare me for the possibility that some years it may be better to home school my daughter and other times it may be better for her to be in a school setting. That's what I like about Lise's practical approach and advice. She advocates that you stay in tune with your child's needs and continue to evaluate how to get those needs met. I think this is a realistic approach, because there is no one-size-fits-all solution for how to educate your child.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"The Good German is another murder\/suspense story by Joesph Kanon set during an interesting time in history. A suspected black marketeer is murdered during the Potsdam conference in the closing days of WWII. There are interesting descriptions and details of the state of Berlin and the uneasy alliance with the Russians at the onset of the Cold War. Although the plot is not exactly the same as \"Los Alamos\", similarities exist with characters involved in a love triangle with a technical back drop (rocket scientists this time). Given the title, I think the author was attempting to provide a Nuremburg-style analysis of German behavior during the war. Who really knew what the Nazis were doing, could the average citizen have done more to stop the genocide, etc.? If you have Werner Von Braun and his team on a pedestal, you might not like this book. Like other efforts by this author, it's too long by at least a 100 pages. He also has a writing style that frequently intermixes character dialog with inner voice commentary that I find difficult to follow at times.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I recently read this book because I loved the movie and figured the book was probably better, as is usually the case.

Hondo is the cowboy of the story; fighting off Indians, killing betrayers, and rescuing Angie and her son Johnny. This story fits the sterotype of westerns with all the gunslinging and violence. Hondo, the character, is the typical cowboy. He never shows his feelings to others, is courageous, rugged, and appealing to the women. Angie, whom is a damsel in distress, depends on him to get her and her son out of the danger that surrounds them, and she trusts him. She is attracted to his exciting and dangerous life; the violence is what makes him so appealing to her. The violence in his life represents his masculinity as a cowboy. Killing Indians and surviving in the desert shows how much power and control he possessess, and the power he has makes him even more masculine in Angie's eyes, therefore increasing the attraction. This book is full of action and constant excitement, and it is simple to read. The positive side to reading this book is that it is entertaing to those people who like westerns. Hondo gives an adventuresome, interesting version of the stereotype of the &quot;old west&quot;. The book seems to fly by as one is reading it.

One of Britain's most respected outdoor educators, Tom followed Eric Shipton into direction of the flagship Outward Bound Mountain School at Eskdale where he hired me green and not golden right out of university. I found his leadership rare, extraordinary and illuminatory then. Reading his book now, I see a reflection of that unforgotten intellectual clarity, fresh as a Lakeland tarn on a cool spring morning. My mother assured me that a book is best read in short bursts. She left little volumes of `thoughts for the day' on the bathroom stool to reinforce the habit. Although Tom's book meets this tough criterion easily for the reader -it is organized burst-wise around discrete and memorable wanderings - there is an honourable purpose to the pilgrimage. He gives an inspiring new twist to the quizzical pilgrim as travailer, as enquiring fellow-wanderer through this mysterious dance we call life. It's a privilege not only for us to share his travail, but also to reflect on his observations. `I have always been an associate, rather than a full member of society, ready to cooperate, but not to belong.' This from an acknowledged and respected leader, who has walked the walk, run the run. This is someone whose perceptiveness we can trust..... as did so many firms, organizations, young people, and, yes, parents during those early risk-taking Outward Bound days.

The now undeniably classic 1926 \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" stands as an almost insurmountable paragon of its genre. And adults can enjoy it as much as kids. Even without kids. The short, and usually laugh out loud hilarious, stories feature a boy, Christopher Robin, and his gang of animated stuffed animals anthropomorphized in the classic childhood fashion. Most of the time no one really knows what's going on, but their improvisations and sometimes strange conclusions almost always turn out for the best. This should sound very familiar, especially to adults. We're basically making it all up as we go along, too, much like Pooh.The first story differs greatly from the others in that most of it gets related through the author via first person to Christopher Robin directly. Other first person episodes pop up here and there, most notably at the very end (which shows that even children's books can use literary devices such as parallelism), but most of the stories contain the classic third person omniscent author. Pooh comes to life, much as Hobbes would decades later in the justly famous \"Calvin and Hobbes\" comic strip, and then ultimately returns to stuffed form only to get dragged up the stairs, head bumping all the way.After Pooh has a run in with some bees, which resulted from some interesting apiological diversionary tactics - none of which succeed - thought up by Christopher Robin and Pooh himself, Pooh then becomes stuck in Rabbit's hole. Rabbit thinks practically and uses his hind legs to hold towels. Next, Wozzle hunting becomes a lesson in circular logic. Piglet's excuse to leave the frightening hunt remains one of the funniest moments in the book. We've all done it, admit it. The perennial curmudgeon Eeyore then loses his tail, but Pooh locates it in a strange, but rather practical, place. Terrifying Heffalumps evade the Heffalump trap cleverly, or not so cleverly, placed by Pooh and Piglet. Moral: when trapping others we often trap ourselves. Eeyore's misery gets somewhat ameliorated by an exploded balloon and an empty honey bucket. Owl helps with the writing, sort of. And then strangers arrive, Kanga and Roo, to the dismay of Rabbit who plots to kidnap Roo and send them both packing. Piglet gets the worst of it after Kanga turns the tables on the gang and the newcomers get to stay. Next everyone goes on an \"Expotition\" to find the North Pole. Pooh happens to pick one up when rescuing Roo from a stream. Next, rain falls in torrents and Piglet finds himself trapped. Only a message in a bottle and an improvised umbrella save him (from the rain and Owl's stories). The collection closes with a party in Pooh's honor, though Eeyore thinks its for him but finds out its not after he delivers an abortive acceptance speech.There's a reason this book has staying power and that it later inspired books on Taoism (\"The Tao of Pooh\" and \"The Te of Piglet\"): \"Winnie-the-Pooh,\" seemingly only for children, is loaded with philosophical reflections on existence, logic, language and the human condition. Of course the stories can be enjoyed without noticing any of these hidden nuggets, but the overall attitude towards life they embrace adds an entire dimension to these innocent tales. And it makes them readable and enjoyable not only to children, but to adults (who probably need to read more these days anyway). For these reasons, and also for the awesome original drawings, this book will likely remain accessible to adults, with or without children, for a long time to come. How long?

This is how Autism is introduced: \"...the way that people with autism see the world gives us a very good sense of what happens when our mind-reading faculties fail.\"(I guess the fact that I still capitalize Autism--when I know it's not technically capitalized tells you I'm not as far removed as I pretend, but anyway....)Gladwell goes on to describe studies on those with Autism and layer by layer establishes that the subjects of these studies lack social awareness including missing social cues and relating to people as objects and often as tools. For those unfamiliar with Autism, this could be a really good look at the symptoms and thought processes of some in the Autism spectrum.For those familiar with Autism and those who've just read this book on how stereotypes color our blink reflexes, his use of the term \"normal\" to describe those in the studies without Autism or just everyone without Autism--grates. In a clinical sense, are Autistic people abnormal in some ways? Yes. Would you ever describe someone's loved one as abnormal? I hope not.And this is where this book fails in my opinion. Gladwell's distilled use and portrayal of Autism as a set of abnormal symptoms often displayed in cases of heightened emotion where people behave rashly and even kill innocent people--is insensitive and possibly even offensive. Our society needs to stop seeing Autism as a clinical term and as a set of symptoms and, now, in a blink--Gladwell has just reinforced them as abnormal.He doesn't imply that Autistic people are unintelligent... in fact: \"Peter is a highly intelligent man. He has graduate degrees from a prestigious university. His IQ is well above normal...\" But then: \"But because he lacks one very basic ability--the ability to mind-read--he can be presented with that scene in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and come to a conclusion that is socially completely and catastrophically wrong.\"Catastrophically wrong.He says an Autistic man's inability to get the commonly-accepted message in a film as catastrophically wrong.Gladwell then goes on to relate many negative, violent, and often fatal situations where \"They didn't take the necessary steps to steer clear of temporary autism.\" \"What police training does, at its best, is teach officers how to keep themselves out of this kind of trouble, to avoid the risk of momentary autism.\"The chapter's primary focus is on the 1999 shooting of unarmed Amadou Diallo by four policeman--who fired at him 41 times when he went to get his wallet out. The police officer was \"not mind-reading now. He's effectively autistic. He's locked in on whatever is coming out of Diallo's pocket, just as Peter was locked in on the light switch in George and Martha's kissing scene.\"A police officer who kills an unarmed man is not effectively Autistic, but using the word in this way is effectively offensive to those dealing with a disorder that now effects 1 in 88 children.Having said that, Gladwell in his typical brilliant way presents the subject of split-second thinking very well through-out the book. I can see what he was trying to achieve here in this chapter by relating it to Autism, but not all disorders can or should be boiled down and dissected to using a part to present the whole. His clinical portrayal of a disorder as only a sum of symptoms can be and probably will be offensive to some. At some points, he swapped out the term \"mind-blind\" and I wish he'd stuck with that.For the record, I couldn't bring myself to knock off a star for this because it's obviously the viewpoint of someone not personally affected by Autism. He didn't get a five star rating because I thought his concluding points in this book weren't as strong as he finished in Outliers.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Residing in Fall River, Massachusetts, makes you curious as to whether the house is haunted.

Fallaci calls herself a Christian atheist. An incongruity I would say. He was who he said he was or he was completely crazy. She is a freelance Christian, instead of relying on God, she relies on her own reason. And that's a lot of relying that brings only rage, a heck of a lot of rage. She also claims not to sympathizeneither with the Right nor the Left, and rejects any political classification other than a revolutionary (do you know any revolution without blood?). Another incongruity, I would say, unless you live in Heaven already. We on earth have to choose, and me as a conservative, would rather choose the less evil.I sympathize with her. I understand her rage. From the very first page you will know that you are up to something special. This ain't no ordinary book. This is not an ignorant person. It's a cultivated woman who knows what she's talking about, who suffered, and sees the injustices around but doesn't mince words. Oh. the rage! She is Achiles' intellectual counterpart.Her message, her warning is call to Europeans to stand up and defend our hard earned western civilization, our culture. We are giving in to Islamo-fascism, we are commiting suicide. The history that Fallaci pours in here falls with the force of a mighty Niagara. One has to become sad reading this. It reminds me also of Job, his complaining to his legalist friends about how innocent he is, about how unjustly he is suffering. He wants a fair trial with God, sure He will understand him and get him off the hook. Who is Fallaci cliaming to? Nobody. We are even lucky we got people like Jefferson, Washington, Hamilton (and maybe somebody in Europe), so few but made it possible today for us to critize freely and not being threatened with our lives. More than lucky!The letter she writes to an Italian Catholic prelate, a bishop who wouldn't bless the coffins of 19 soldiers killed in Irak, and said it pained him to witness the celebrations that took place in their honor, is well worth putting here: \"If that Sunday Jesus Christ had had the misfortune to find himself (she doesn't capitalize Him) in the Caserta cathedral, his disdain for the temple's Pharisee merchants would have become a joke in comparison to his disdain for you. He would have kicked your assand thrown you out into the square, and here he would have smashed so hard your face that day that you would not even be able to eat a tomato soup.\" And she is not a Christian. Amazing!In lack of a proletariat the neo-commies have fopund in the Arab masses their natural allies. This, in a few words, explains the tremendous success of the take-over of Islam in Europe, the craddle of Socialism (Nazi and Commy).What does not amuse me is Fallaci's irreverent dismissal of religions in general. Here's one comment on account of Abraham, in his role as the Founder of Israel: \"Who wants a Founding Father who is ready to slit his own son's throat for the glory of some God?\" Inadvertently given herself the answer: It is not 'some' God; it is the one and only God. But otherwise her question would be rightly put.There's a lot that she talks about in this book, but I think I understand her best when she points to \"the presumption and assumption of holding the Truth (by the Left). Its dogmatism\" as the unforgivable sin of the Left. Meaning this: They want to put us in an intellectual ghetto, where freedom of speech would be irrelevant, useless, since we would be outside society. It is a Holocaust ofthe soul.What good is freedom? Lenin once asked. Only Fallaci seemed to have enough rage to shout the answer back.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I picked up this book inadvertently -- and was well-rewarded.

This is the third novel (and the last) in his series about Number Ten Ox and Master Li, detectives, trouble-shooters, and general mischief-makers. The middle volume, 'The Story of the Stone,' is not presently in print, although chances of finding it used are still good.The two find themselves in attendance at the Peking execution day, where the current royal execution is going for a record 1,071 clean decapitations. At the very last moment, a vampire ghoul makes a daytime appearance in hot pursuit of the city guard. This causes the Devil's Hand to miss his stroke, and Master Li jumps at the opportunity to investigate. Finding that one of the vampire's victims appears to be an august resident of the Forbidden City, Master Li confronts the Celestial Master (the wisest Confucian in the realm) and is invited to investigate what appears to be an impossible series of events.Befriending a roving puppeteer and his beautiful daughter, Master Li and Number Ten chase across China looking for clues in what appears to be a complex smuggling plot that uses magical, golden cages as telephones. However, the cages are more than etheric portables, and the present holders of them keep meeting horrible fates at the hands of weird monsters and an ape. Who these creatures are, the purpose of the cages, and what any of this has to do with the annual Death Birds Ghost Boat Rain Race are the mysteries that Master Li has to solve.This is a plot that sends the reader careening across the pages like a pinball in a bumper factory. The sense of the tale is always just beyond the reader's grasp as Hughart unfolds Number Ten's narrative at high pace. Readers who relish an orderly progression of development and characters that make dependable sense may find this a bit unsatisfactory. Hughart seems determined to exceed the more controlled chaos of 'Bridge of Birds' and this is not all for the good. I found the confusion a bit too ... confusing.This is more of a burlesque, compared to Kai Lung's wry sarcasm, but it still works. Beware taking the plot for granted, since almost nothing is really what it seems. Hughart's ability to make impossible characters work is undeniable, and he has either a vivid imagination or access to a large collection of Chinese myths. While this tale is not up to the standards of 'Bridge of Birds' it is still a genuinely enjoyable read. And a pleasant change of pace for people for those who spend too much time with weightier tomes.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"This story has the power to transform any Christians' attitude toward the power of prayer, the Intent of Evil and the battle that rages over the Soul of Man.

This was by far my favorite of the things we read (we read such other things as Vanity Fair, The Ring and the Book).This is really a long book about ordinary circumstances in a 19th century rural area in England. So why is a book such as this one considered such a classic even though not many particularly grand events happen?The book is the study of the ordinary in many ways. You end up seeing how different people live and deal with different situations and what kinds of people they are. At the same time that the reader comes to judgments about the people in the book, George Eliot manages to portray most of her characters sympathetically. Even the worst people in the book are rounded out in some ways and Eliot tries to imbue a sense of humanity. It portrays an &quot;adult&quot; view of the world instead of the simplistic view of the child. In fact, Dorothea makes a journey during the book from a child with a romanticized view to an adult with a more rich understanding through life experience and wisdom.If you're looking for a book about exciting events, with high drama, with a fast pace, don't bother picking this book up since you'll probably dislike it. This is a book written by a woman and expressing some criticisms of a woman's place in the world of her time. It is also a book that explores a more ordinary setting and viewpoint than perhaps most male authors of the time would write in such depth about. She brings a different experience than most male or female authors of the 19th century. Male authors focused on grander events (their characters often fighting to get somewhere in life) while many female authors showed a romanticized view of life and love. Look at the romances of Jane Austin in which a good marriage seems to be the ultimate goal, or the stormy loves of Emily Bronte in which some strange control\/love dynamic becomes magnified to almost heroic proportions. The author is showing something unique, more restrainted, less extreme, more &quot;middle&quot; or ordinary. She manages to pull off a more balanced or &quot;middle&quot; view, also. I noticed some other readers mentioned that it was slow, that they thought events were predictable, or other similar criticisms. These criticisms are valid as far as they go--but they miss the point since these elements aren't really the center of this book.In fact, Middlemarch is really about a somewhat mundane existance that is inhabited by many people in the real world. We aren't immune to a mundane existance today: work; TV; having enough money to get by; domestic squabbles; eating; relating to other people; perhaps dreaming of something grand but not accomplishing it. There are many events of a mostly ordinary nature that gradually lead one way or another in the lives of people (both ourselves and others around us).Really this book is about gradual changes, about good acts and bad acts. It's about coming to some state of acceptance and a kind of enlightenment in life. It's about making the unexceptional life one of meaning even when circumstances prevent many large or great things. It's about a hard-to-define quality called &quot;goodness&quot; even absent huge acts or events.In any case, give this book a read if you like 19th century English literature since it's one of the greats of the period. It's also one of my favorites since I feel as though the author is treating the reader as an adult, without pulling punches, while explaining something about the life that most actual people experience.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I read this as a paperback many years ago, as well as many of the books in the series.

END","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This is a very well written book in the sense of being grammatically correct and very persuasive in the logic of their arguments.I take issue with the overall tone of the book in one particular but fundamental area to which I shall return later.In the case of welfare reform, it is clear that all western industrialised societies are now facing a fundamental truth. The idea that public expenditures can keep on growing, financed through taxation to maintain nationalised industries and socialised programmes is one which is well past it's sell by date. Even today, over four years since this publication was produced, the paragon of socialized provision, Sweden, is learning that they cannot squeeze ever more money out of the private, productive sector or even individual consumers.That being said, social programmes, often despite the best of intentions have repeatedly been shown to have unitended consequences which are far reaching in their impact and which often create increased demands on the welfare state.Others have shown how welfare programmes can enslave huge numbers of the population and create an underclass of people who become disenfranchised from regular society. There has, to considerable degree been a convergence of views between right and left over the detrimental effects of over-generous welfare programmes although I would hesitate to say that there has yet been a meeting of minds upon the subject. Some left-radical figures such as Frank Field have thought seriously about such issues and have suggested reforms to the systems but often those who adminster government recoil at implementing what are often very radical socutions which will have short to medium term political repercussions which will in turn affect those who introduce them.As far as the concern for learning the lessons for recent reforms is concerned this little pamphlet will add to the debate which must continue as there is a long way to go and is a useful contribution to that debate.Norman Dennis' contribution however, brings me to another side of the debate which is less savoury. Dennis takes on the notion of sexual liberation which to me is a fundamental attack on the rights and roles of women in society. The tone of the article is clearly articulated attack on the right of people to form some sort of union with other people rather than form a permanent relationship in the form of heterosexual marriage. Dennis supports his attacks on the inadequacies of alternative arrangements throgh the use of published statistics and anecdotal tales of local events. He sets up the straw man only to knock it down again. He belittles the portrayal of strong women in the media by arguing that these are all women of independent means and who are not typical of the population in general. What he is suggesting is that this is propaganda from those in society who wish to undermine our society and who have no regard for a more conservative view of the evolution of society came about. By doing so he suggests that traditional family values are eternal and have proved time and again to provide benefits to those involved in them and which will be lost in the tsunai of radical change.Dennis is very persuasive here and articlates a vision found in earlier generations of politicians who long for a mythological golden age when women were happy with their lot and did not mind depending on men for their fulfillment. This view permeates across the left and right boundaries of politics.It suggests that women are not capable of holding careers and being involved in family life unless they have independent means and that is the chink in the armour.The answer is to assist women in attaining that financial independence and increasing their ability to participate in society as individuals and not as people who can only achieve that success by marrying into wealth. The notion that only some form of marriage rite endorsed by the state is the only institutional arrangement that can benefit both participants is laughable. A more likely scenario is some form of private, legal contract between the two parties can achieve similar if not even better results. What is at issue here is that we are currently in a form of societal organisation where in some respects women are equal to men but not in others. Equality of opportunity does not need to involve social programmes of housing and child support. It may need to provide some of those things. Women are however, burdened by an inequality of chances to play the game in the same way as men. They are not as easily likely to achieve financial independence which would allow them to compete and it is this which must be dealt with. Sexual liberation is one thing. True independence is another. Reasserting traditional marriages will not help either.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"one of the top 10 or so books you must read in your lifetime. but don't expect to find a dry eye in the house when you're done. as sad as it is beautiful.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Despite the possibly cold- and academic-sounding title, The Social Sources of Denominationalism is actually a passionate, engaging read. Its premise is that the rise of Christian sects shows that the Christian churches have failed in their ethical duty. They should all be preaching the single unified truth of Christ's love, says Niebuhr, whereas instead they each reflect the economic and social traits of the people in their sects.Throughout history, says Niebuhr (brother of the more-famous Reinhold Niebuhr), sects have arisen when their parent church has grown remote from a vital Christianity; sects are a continual attempt to renew the religion. Also, says Niebuhr, the revolution and the new sect have always come from below: the existing church tends to gain respectability over time, and gain middle-class adherents, thereby drawing further and further away from an emotionally appealing experience of Christ and more towards a cold, academic understanding of God. The poor, says Niebuhr, have always sought a more direct -- emotional, arms flailing, speaking-in-tongues -- connection with god, which \"respectable\" churches are loath to provide. And those respectable churches are much better at telling the poor to mind their own business and accept their station, than they are at elevating that station.So ultimately, the \"ethical failure of the divided church\" (title of the first chapter) is the church's failure toward its most needy members.

Also its a short book so don't despair when Bronte begins drowning in her own philosophies and metaphors during the middle passages (you'll find them) and be happy for what this book can provide for anyone who has ever felt the need to take care of their family.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Multi-talented doesn't begin to describe Jan Pienkowski. Born in Poland in 1936 he made his first book when he was only 8-years-old. It was a gift for his father. Due to the war his family left Poland and eventually settled in England where he would attend Kings College. It seems that his interest in stage design developed while he was there.Since his college days he has worked in publicity, advertising, and done stage designs for The Royal Ballet and Disneyland, Paris. Here, in America, we probably know him best for his amazing paper art. His pop-up books don't just spring forward, but swirl as in an octopus busily doing dishes or soar as in three geese flying across a mantel. Youngsters will be delighted to find this and so very much more in Haunted House.This is a place where ghosts hide under the stairwell and a portrait of La Gio Conda watches with the touch of a tab. Refrigerator doors swing open to reveal a very Muenster-like kitchen, while King Kong holds forth in the living room.Each double page is an amazing array of spooky sights just waiting for young fingers to release them.

Yuta recognizes the man -- Shingo, a rich young psycho who died with his sister Akiko long ago. But actually, they ate mermaid's flesh with differing effects. Now Shingo is immortal, and Akiko is still alive, trapped in a living doll's body. Now Shingo is trying to find and kill his sister -- because so long as she is alive, he is pursued by a horrifying vision...In &quot;Mermaid's Mask,&quot; Yuta and Mana come across a little boy called Nanao who escaped from a moving car. When Nanao takes some &quot;medicine,&quot; his scrapes instantly heal, and the immortal pair suspect that he's like them. But the real truth comes to mind when they learn that the boy's mother has kidnapped him from her own son -- and that because of the mermaid's flesh, she can tear off her own scarred face and replace it with another...Don't expect humor and lightness in Takahashi's Mermaid Saga. There's the occasional moment of dry humor, like Mana constantly referring to Nanao as &quot;squirt.&quot; But overall it's even more violent and gruesome than the other Mermaid stories, such as when Nanao's &quot;mother&quot; skins her own face, though Takahashi keeps it tastefully shadowed.Mana and Yuta have changed a little over the course of the series -- Yuta is a little happier and less haunted, and Mana has become less clueless. They mesh well together, although they are not explored quite as much in this volume as in the previous two. And supporting characters -- like the insanely possessive mother, or the evil Shingo -- are chillingly well-drawn.Things get nasty and bloody in the third excellent volume of Takahashi's Mermaid Saga. &quot;Mermaid's Gaze&quot; is a good horror-fantasy read -- just don't read it after dark.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Prepare yourself to delve into a world so rich, so full of life and history that you will have trouble distinguising it from something real.

I picked up The Hobbit quite some time ago, I think I was in the 4th grade.From the moment I read the first words &quot;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.&quot;, I just couldn't put it down.This book does, however, lack a few things. Smut, trash, cussing, and all of the other all too common things these days. This is pure fantasy, pure enjoyment.My only wish is that I had never read it, so that I could enjoy the experience of reading it the first time again.I warn you.

His motto is you don't stop until the job is done. So, when he met up with Louisa Bonaventure in Minnesota during her search for revenge on the Red River Gang that killed her family, he decided to help her out. Partly because of the reward on their leader, Handsome Dave Duvall, but also because Louisa, whom Prophet dubbed \"The Vengeance Queen,\" was only 17 years old and might be in need of some assistance (and protection).Since then, the duo have whittled the formerly 20 members of the Red River Gang down to one: Duvall himself, and Prophet wants to take him alone and, if possible, alive. It's part of the bounty hunter code. But \"Miss Bonny-venture\" wants Duvall for herself, as well, and is willing to die for the pleasure.The Devil Gets His Due is the fourth novel by author Peter Brandvold to feature bounty hunter Lou Prophet. A prolific writer, Brandvold is the author of multiple series, including the Sheriff Stillman Once books, the Cuno Massey .44-Caliber series, and the Rogue Lawman books. He also writes under the pseudonym Frank Leslie and is reportedly one of the stable of authors writing regularly for the long-running Longarm series.Based on the evidence of The Devil Gets His Due, Brandvold will be a new favorite. He starts out with action and keeps it coming. His grasp of character is modern yet authentic to the period, and I especially enjoyed that he doesn't take the traditional route regarding an expected love interest between Prophet and Louisa. This alone let me know I was reading a writer of imagination and originality. I've already added three more of his novels to my collection, hoping to sample each of his series in turn. Then I hope to track down some of his newest books.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I think this book suitable for everyone not only for child but adult also can read it.

It is an exploration into a whimsical universe but yet grounded in a real and recognizable Victorian place... Nice for those who have not yet acquired a taste for complicated science fiction and fantasy.My favorite part of the book was the characterizations of the children and their families and a critical part of my enjoyment was the hilarious and classical Joseph Schindelman illustrations. His pictures are truly inspired and cleverly silly... and appear to so accurately portray the essence of each character and scene... as though he knew exactly what Roald Dahl meant - even though this is a fantasy that could have many different visual interpretations. They captured my imagination and added immeasureably to the fun of the story. As a child I had absolutely no desire to see the Gene Wilder movie because the illustrations were so integral to the story in my mind. They remind me of the illustrations in the \"Le Petit Nicholas\" series (illustrated by Jean Jacque Sempe). . .which are so expressive and cute and elegantly done that they don't even need to be in color.The new edition illustrations are so disappointing in comparison. It's really too bad that the new generation of young readers will be eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with no peanut butter. I will instead look for a used copy of the older edition to give as a gift because introducing this wonderful book to a young child without those original illustrations would not be doing it justice.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Eight hundred thousand men, women and children were killed in a hundred days in Rwanda in the spring of 1994, most of them in the first 50 days. These killings were acts of incredible violence by otherwise ordinary people, neighbors, friends, co-workers, classmates and sometimes family members of the victims. How could such a thing have happened?The author, a staff writer for the New Yorker, offers as an explanation for why he was so curious about Rwanda, that &quot;The best reason I have come up with for looking closely into Rwanda's stories is that ignoring them makes me even more uncomforable about existence and my place in it.&quot; Gourevitch holds that the genocide in Rwanda was not a spontaneous, emotional response to years of bad history, but part of a long and planned out process. This was not a brewing madness that came over the Hutus, nor simply the result of years of disagreements with another race living in the same country. Instead, it was a political plan of the same nature as the Final Solution in Nazi Germany.Although I have listened to, spoken with and even written a little about our Friend, Amminadab Munyaneza (in a local newsletter - Amminadab was in a Master's program in my home town), I never quite understood what had happened in Rwanda. When I saw this book I thought it might offer answers to questions I've had for years. Why do people do such things? What can we do to change the situation? Surely someone must have known what was going to happen.The book was an intriguing, sad and useful read, a mixture of history, true stories including at least one hero, and the author's own outrage. Greed, politics and fear were key components, along with the abandonment of Rwanda by the UN and its supporting countries. I learned a little - I was not aware that the refugee camps Amminidab spoke of held more Hutus than Tutsis (for most of the Tutsis had been murdered), that many of those who committed atrocities were mixed in with those who had not, that the Tutsis who survived sought revenge, often on Hutus who had done no harm, that the murders (Hutus of Tutsis; Tutsis of Hutus) were still going on well into 1998.The recent awareness of problems in Kosovo have made it sadly clear that `racial cleansing' and genocide are still among us. And so the questions increase. Will Rwanda ever be healed? Will Kosovo? Is it possible for this to happen anywhere? What can we do, can I do?Reading this book did not answer the questions, but it a little clarity to what happened.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This book is one that every single medical student or history enthusiast must own. It gives particularly accurate insight on the life and work of one of the most brilliant and important medical geniuses of the \"rebirth\". With unsurpassed detail and beautiful arrangement, anatomy has not been represented in such an incredible and accurate way, given the context and the times in which Andreas Vesalius developed his research (dissection was outlawed and Galenus' theories on anatomy, which were based on animal anatomy, were considered dogma) and the extremely poor conditions and knowledge of the human body up until that point in time. Like all great scientists and researchers, Vesalius' recognition came after his death, but it is still a great way to honor him to get to know a little about his life and work, which this book does in such a fine way. The quality of the paper in which it was printed lets the reader get the whole picture and because of it's oppasity you can enjoy all the details as if you were looking at the original work. The price is also quite a bargain, which, needless to say, is a fair trait in itself. As a personal note, when I first read and saw some of the paintings within Vesalius' \"De Humani Corporis Fabrica\", that was the moment when I realized my destiny was in the medical profession; and years later I can see it was not a bad choice at all.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Currently, I'm about 2\/3 through this book, so I'm not saying anything about the ending! The characters spend the whole book speaking in pages of expository technical details on how to survive on Mars in a forced and stilted fashion. Their dialogs are about as far from &quot;realistic&quot; as you can get, so for me they fell flat.The opening for the book was an absolute killer for a novel; two large chapters of Congressional hearings, after a 2-page prologue explaining some of the lead-in events on Mars. If I wasn't such a Mars fanatic, I wouldn't have made it past these chapters.Technically, I'm enjoying the book. Most everything in it has been completely predictable, but that might be due in part to the fact I've read most of the other &quot;Mars&quot; books currently in print, so the way they set up their colony, such as it is, is old news to me. It's not a page-turner, but I'm not stopping either. It's a bit of a treatise on setting up a colony, in many respects, so some readers may get a lot of pleasure out of it for that.One of the most enjoyable parts of the book are Cronin's insights into Zen Buddhism, perhaps because I know nothing about it.","sentiment_score":0.6},{"review":"First off, let me say this is a great fun read and once you begin you better be prepared to read, because you will get hooked.

In Little Women, author Louisa May Allcott shows the life of four sisters. Meg is a quiet proper young lady, who in spite of here desire of wealth, falls in love with her neighbor's poor tutor.

Mia and her family live in Northern Illinois next to a big valley. The time that passes in this story is about half a year. Mia is the middle child in her family, along with her cat named Mango. No one knows that Mia has synesthesia-a crossing of senses-so that means whenever she hears a sound, it has a certain color and shape to her. For example, her cat weezes mango-colored puffs and that's why she named her cat Mango. Mia is having problems with a couple of subjects in school like math. She can't concentrate because of all the colors bombarding her. Her teachers don't know about it either. So they are wondering. Jenna, her best friend, is not aware of it either. When Mia starts having so much trouble she finally just has to tell her parents and Jenna. Jenna becomes really mad about that then they break up for a while. Later, they both apologize and become friends again, and of course everyone at school now knows and Mia becomes really popular at school. Mia sees a doctor and is told that she has synesthesia and gets to know some people that also have it. She is kmazed by all their stories. I thought this was a very good book for lots of people to read. I thought that Mia, the main character, was always happy, nice and cheerful throughout the book even though she had difficulties. Some of the main charaters are Mia, and Jenna, Mia's best friend. Unfortunately, Jenna's mom died and Mia's grandfather died but they are both buried in the same grave yard and Mia beieves that her grandfather's soul is in Mango. And each of them are about 13 years old. I really liked this book because it makes you want to read all the time.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Pros: Alright, so this guy can write. He can even write well, most of the time. Good. He can even write well and manage not to contradict established scientific facts. Great. He writes well, pens good action sequences, and creates witty dialog. Amazing! But is he among the best? Man, there are a few short stories in here that are nothing short of gold, just gold. He spares not the details nor the mood, and the characters are seductively real. He has sympathy for the feminine persona that is dynamic and believable. He sticks to the story as opposed to weird tangents that have nothing to do with anything. Yes, he's really really good.Cons: The \"weakest\" section of this collection is the novella \"I am Legend.\" Yes it is worthy of the title of classic as it does vampires right yet again (Twilight, this ain't) with a fresh perspective that is necessary when you reuse a classic image like the vampire. Its weak point is its main character. Perhaps realistically, he fumbles about quite a bit and has deep emotional problems that prevent him from taking care of things until crisis is inevitable. This is a little more distracting that I would've liked, for I was fascinated by the vampire plague the author masterfully constructs and with a flawed lens, there are some things that we never get around to. Fortunately, this isn't the only story with the undead in it.Summary: These days, we take horror survival techniques for granted, but in the 1950s when this was written, they'd only just passed the golden age of film horror. Goth subculture predecessors like the Munsters and the Addams Family hadn't hit the scene yet. Horror was presented by the likes of Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, and Vincent Price. For its time, this survival-horror genre book, with accompanying short stories featuring so many psychic and apocalyptic visions, is a real rarity and genuinely good despite its age. It stands well above most of its contemporaries, such as Psycho by Robert Bloch or The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson. And, not to be a spoiler, none of the movies do it credit - NONE.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"&quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; feels like something Charles Dickens would have written if he had been a more efficient storyteller, more economical in his prose, and had a better understanding of how humor is supposed to be applied to tragedy, if at all -- with subtlety and congruity. This is not intended to be a slight against Dickens, but rather a testament to the quality of Thomas Hardy's writing.The first chapter alone is a dramatic masterpiece and perfectly sets the rhythm for the rest of the novel. A young man named Michael Henchard and his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane enter a village where Henchard hopes to find work as a hay-trusser. They go to a country fair where Henchard immediately gets drunk and sells his wife and baby to a sailor. Regretting his actions the next day, Henchard looks for them in vain, swears off liquor for twenty-one years, then takes up residence in a town called Casterbridge.Nineteen years later, Susan, now widowed, and Elizabeth-Jane track Henchard to Casterbridge. It turns out that in the intervening years, Henchard has become a successful granary owner and is now the town's mayor. He welcomes his former wife and daughter, proving himself to be genial but often petty and easily vexed. For one thing, he is in a bitter rivalry with a former employee, a young Scotchman named Donald Farfrae, not only in business but also for the affections of a vixenish woman named Lucetta who has recently moved to town.Hardy wastes no pages unfolding the plot, which is filled with Dickensian intrigue. It chronicles Henchard's relationship with Susan and Elizabeth-Jane after their return, his jealousy over Farfrae and Lucetta (who happens to be Henchard's old flame and inadvertently incites a public scandal because of this), his fear of the discovery of his deceit, and, finally, his feelings of isolation from Elizabeth-Jane and the town he loves. By the end, you realize that Henchard is not a bad man; he's a lonely man who's made the mistake of letting his love for Elizabeth-Jane distort his judgment.Especially impressive is Hardy's prose, which is strong and descriptive without being florid. He has a sharp ear for native dialects, and the dialogue of Casterbridge's inhabitants comes off as genuinely homey chatter rather than just dispensations of information set up to advance the plot. Moreover, like any good fictional place, Casterbridge takes on a vibrant life of its own, offering a realistic bucolic backdrop for this stormy human drama.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Perhaps Joanne Harris had a hard time identifying with a male perspective.

Perhaps she had her own 'Nick' (a minor in this novel, Nick is the pushy publishing rep who tries to convince the main character, Jay, to hurry his follow up novel through the presses). Who knows? But this book just didn't have the panache of \"Five Quarters of the Orange\" and \"Chocolat\". The plot struggles at times and characters from the other novels make cameos with no apparent purpose other than to remind the reader that this book is by the same author. Sigh. Just like Peter Mayle, Joanne Harris has strong sophmore efforts that are well worth reading but seems to fall flat in this subsequent attempt. If you haven't yet read \"Five Quarters...\", I would highly recommend it for it's complex yet well crafted storylines.

To think that I forced myself all the way though those long pages only to see that as my reward. One word for that ending, horrificly pathetic. All right, that was two.Back to the characters. Poorly developed, and if I hadn't known them before, I think I would have rooted for the antagonists to kill them off, just for the excitement. Its what Silverberg should have done, or something like it. This book was duller than lectures. It was like, almost reading a very unrealistic history noevl, where the you strangely get to experience the hourly introspectives of the characters that NO ONE CARES ABOUT.Personally, I would have rather done my homework, but my own pride in the fact that I've never not finished a book kept me from that. And while the first two books only took me a week or so to read, this one took twice that, despite the fact its shorter. (If there wouldn't have been the boring introspectives and side stories, I might have finished it in a minute.)So, if you are a fan of the other books, you don'thave to get this book. Have someone just tell you how it ends, and spare yourself three hundred some odd other pages.

Some of Mordden's other fiction is even better than this novel, but I was impressed at how Mordden sustains the epic style of this 590 page \"brick\" of a book. Mordden's other works of fiction tend to be episodic, essentially amounting to interweaved short stories, but this massive work shows the author's unanticipated skill in creating a work of such panoramic scale.The book comprises the accounts of a series of fictional characters whose lives eventually (and ingeniously) come seemlessly to intersect, being tales of the lives of gay men and lesbians from 1949 to 1991 and of the American society of those changing times. This is really is an huge accomplishment, never flagging in interest or in coherence. The characters are very sympathetic, for all their peculiarities and failings, which Mordden does not flinch from recounting. My favourite two characters are Blue, a kind-hearted, rustic Southern guy (of the variety so often denigrated as \"poor white trash\"), who also happens to be of irresistible good looks and multi-orgasmic sexual potency, turned loose in New York City (and parts beyond), and Walt, a very cute and lovably quirky musician from the Midwest, whom fate brings together with Blue, then separates, and finally reunites, amidst the adventures of many other fascinating boys, men (some of them those boys grown older), and women.Some readers have complained of the artificial and overly highbrow dialogue, but, for the most part, I disagree with this caveat. It is, usually, the more intellectual and politically activist personalities who express themselves in this way, in their own cerebrally \"naturally unnatural\" way of speech, as it were. The more earthier and more direct characters usually express themselves in vocabulary and diction that are natural and quite believable. The variety of the ways in which each converses abets Mordden's strongly individualised portrayals of them. I find it amazing that a writer from the Mid-Atlantic states (the part of the U. S. of A. from which Mordden hails) is able to capture with such authenticity the folkways and speech patterns of the rural, Southern character from the backwoods that Blue so quintessentially is, conveying with such rightness the slang, accent, regional archaisms, word order, and all the rest of Blue's very Dixified way of expressing himself, with utter believability, yet without any sense of artificiality or of literary condescension whatsoever.Despite the length of the novel, I was sorry when I arrived at the end of this immense piece of fiction. I wanted it to go on and on, to over the years following the 1990s and the later lives and adventures of the intensely interesting people who populate its pages. Perhaps fate already has given Mordden the wisdom and opportunity to write a sequel that is awaiting publication, of the kind that he has produced so often in his delightful \"Buddies\" series of novels.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"If you're looking for a way to pick up a few words and get started in a new language, Pimsleur can't be beat.

After singing \"Oh Promise Me\" around 5,000 times in 3,000 performances of the musical \"Robin Hood\" (the numerical discrepancy was because the audience often demanded an encore of the then-wildly popular song), Ms. Davis relates that she tried to insert a different song into the wedding section. She didn't get very far: after a few measures of the new song, the audience began calling for \"Oh Promise Me\" and Davis ran off the stage laughing.All I could find in current books was that Ms. Davis had debuted the song and that the song's popularity was the reason for the longevity of the musical \"Robin Hood\"; no where else but in \"Prima Donnas and Soubrettes\" did I find this amusing little anecdote about her weariness in singing it.\"Prima Donnas and Soubrettes\" has priceless information that current books on American musical theater have lost forever; for those interested in the subject, it is a real treasure.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"From the preface: \"There is a great dearth of literature on Indian fairs and festivals, except negligiable treatises in our vernaculars that too are mostly sectoral in treatment and very few standard books for English readers are now made available.

At the time, I rejected Dreyfus arguments, believing, as did most AI researchers, that all we needed to do to create a true artificial intelligence was a fast enough computers and enough information about objects, symbols, and representations. From that, intelligence would arise from the \"emergent properties\" of the system.A few years later I was a grad student in cognitive psychology, and thanks to my cognitive studies and a careful reading of Wittgenstein's writing on language, my opinion of both Dreyfus and GOFAI (good old fashioned AI) had changed radically. Meaning is not just labels and symbols. As Wittgenstein observed, meaning can only arise from a shared experience, something that a machine and a human cannot have- at least given our current level of hardware.The AI community has since come around (largely) to accept most of Dreyfus' critique, while never actually acknowledging his role in shaping the aims of AI, so the AI or cognitive sciences student reading Dreyfus today may wonder what much of the debate is about. But this is a book that all AI and cognitive science students about read, both to understand how the AI paradigm changed between the 1970s and the present, and to get a better idea of the philosophical issues that Dreyfus raised that still are salient today.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I read the book and it is great.

Consequently, presenting Ryan the statesman forces Clancy to actually write dialogue, a skill with which he is clearly ill-adept and uncomfortable. The stilted, repetitious prose is unbelievable in the true sense of that word -- i.e., a husband and wife (Jack and Cathy) or a man and his best friend (Jack and Robbie)do not have to provide an extended factual foundation for every thought they wish to convey to each other (for example, Jack simply need not say to his wife: &quot;Since you are a surgeon, I know that you care for people, and therefore this situation impacts you more deeply . . . blah, blah, blah . . . finally, here's the point&quot;). No wonder the book soars past 1000 pages, it seems that no one edited it! It is practically insulting that Clancy does not trust his readers to understand and interpret the complexities of his characters, especially considering that most of the readers of this book are surely not Clancy first-timers. Substantively, Clancy's use of Jack Ryan to espouse Clancy's own half-thought, wrongheaded political and social values is tiresome, and makes me like this character less and less. I remember not being able to finish &quot;Executive Orders&quot; the first time through since I was so turned off by its &quot;Clancyism.&quot; Then a friend suggested that maybe I just wasn't reading it fast enough.

This book was recommended by so many crime fiction readers that I thought I'd check it out. I was interested in how one of the most noteworthy real life serial killers compared against his fictional counterparts.Many aspects of Ted Bundy's life of crime really are the stuff of novels, and no doubt have inspired many. Women of a specific and similar physical appearance disappearing all over the country are like something from a James Patterson book. Like Hannibal Lecter, Ted Bundy had formal psychiatric training and was experienced at administering the same psychological tests that were given to him in prison. He is cunning enough to escape prison, and adept at procuring fake identities and eluding the police. No maladjusted misfit, he was personable, charming, attractive to women - while capable of chilling rages where, in a single night, he could savage 4 different women, racing, bloodstained, from one college dorm to another.Much of the book is about Bundy's trials and time in prison - details absent from most fiction, which usually conveniently end after the perpetrator's discovery. While Bundy himself could hold his own as a fictional character, what really differs is the lack of any cohesive protaganist. While many individual police worked long and hard on his cases over the years, there was no idea for a long while that many of his attacks were connected, a situation that surely could not have escaped, for instance, a Lucas Davenport. Once the police finally manage to convict him - on only three of a known 35 and suspected 150 murders - the suspense moves to Bundy's fight against his execution date, which is postponed many times. Bundy repeatedly gains time by promising to confess - although already convicted, confessions to the any of the dozens of outstanding suspicious disappearances are a powerful bargaining tool for him due to the closure that it brings to these victim's relatives. The thought of so many real families in such uncertain agony - some of them, still - is very upsetting.Whether Ms Rule's unique persective on the Ted Bundy case actually adds anything to the story is hard to say - despite their long friendship, she seems as baffled as everyone else as to how or why the kind and sensitive guy she knew could be a brutal and sadistic killer. Everyone who reads this by now knows the facts of the case, and it's hard to share any of her initial support of Bundy. This book's effectiveness is its thoroughness in showing the untidy fringes and loose ends that accompany real life crime - it's a scary, thought-provoking, and worthwhile read.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"The idea of the book is great.

Although it can be read on its own, it is best appreciated as the third in a series.Let me first start by commenting on the trilogy as a whole (you can see my reviews on the first two books). This trilogy provides excellent overall background to all the novels of faulkner. In it he talks about most of the main characters of yoknapatawpha county, mississippi which run through all of his work. \"The mansion\" in particular ties many of these people and history together. In addition to that, it tells the fascinating story of the snopes family.In \"the mansion\" faulkner retells most of what has occurred in the prior two books. This allows the reader to enjoy this novel on its own. For the trilogy reader he makes it interesting by changing the point of view. In \"the town\" v. k. ratliff tells the story of mink snopes and his murder of jack houston. In the retelling in \"the mansion\" the story is told by mink himself; a totally different perspective. Faulkner also, in sections of the book, reverts back to the omniscient narrator in this book whereas in \"the town\" 3 individuals tell the story from their perspective. point of view is one of the most intriguing aspects of faulkner's style.In this novel, he concludes the stories of the main snopes' characters and other characters in the trilogy. There is a clear air of fate that doesn't appear in the other novels. The story centers on mink, linda, and flem. Each ones destiny is irreversible. Even gavin stevens is fated to become a co-conspirator in murder.As before, we never see into the head of the main character, flem snopes. He has clearly become bored with life as he defeated everyone in his way to becoming the most powerful person in jefferson. Why, at the end he takes no steps to save himself from mink is described by ratliff like rules of the game he has been playing. Is he also bored with life?Faulkner is a masterful writer.

It was heavy going, and pretty meaningless to me at the time. It has come to be one of my favourite books, and I have read it more than once. The thing about hardy is that the sense of place, and time is so evocative. I have lived as an adult in Dorset - hardy Country, and recognise many of the locales he writes so beautifully about. More astounding is that some of the social mores and economic system ( indentured labour, tied villages) still exist. Like Dickens, coincidence plays a heavy hand in Hardy's plot development, a contrivance that is a little agitating to the modern, more cynical reader. Still, I find it entiely appropriate to an era when people were most often trapped in a life dictated by circumstance, when free will didn't play nearly as large a part as it does now, in a Britain where there was no place for a meritocracy, class and social station being everything. Some vestiges of that are still very evident in English life (Royalty representing the apex of the class system).

Hurstwood's character reminded me much of a male version of Anna, and I believe Dreiser did an EXCELLENT job at writing his demise. The novel drips irony off every page. Hurstwood and Carrie have more or less switched social positions by the end of the novel. In order to understand the full value of the novel, and why it is so daring and ahead of its time, the reader MUST remove himself from today's time period. I compare this novel to Anna Karenina because much like Tolstoy wrote of Anna's demise in society, Dreiser writes of Hurstwood's demise in society: the new industrial America. On the other hand, Carrie was achieving unspeakable status all on her own. This was unheard of by a woman at the turn of the century.The second half of the novel Dreiser develops the theme of chance, and how it led Carrie, Hurstwood, and Drouet to where they are in life. Unfortunately, he does not ever return to Carrie's sister. I would have liked to learn a little more about her and her family as well as where times took them.Dreiser also explores Carrie's fascination with materialism. Probably one of my favorite parts of the novel was when Carrie realized money wouldn't buy her happiness. Here Dreiser reflects Camus' ideas of happiness versus reality. No matter what she bought, it was never enough, and Carrie was never able to achieve the happiness she dreamed of. &quot;In your rocking-chair, by your window, shall you dream such happiness as you may never feel.&quot;All in all, this book is an excellent read. Anyone wishing to find a book to fall in love with-- the characters, the setting, plot, etc.-- this book is a must.

This book also contains many hilarious &quot;scenes&quot; of family interactions. It's a light, feel-good read that's especially a nice change of pace if you typically read &quot;heavier&quot; books. If your taste in movies leans toward well-written, light, romantic comedies, this book is for you!","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"'The Hobbit' never gets boring.

Although lacking in statistics for the prominent Teragen leaders, something the makers of Aberrent seem hesitant to reveal in the other sup's as well, the rich detail of the inner workings of the Teragen and the philosophies that guide them make this an interesting read.Using the universal archetype's of Marvel, Monster and Portent, the Teragen are potentially the most powerful and dangerous faction in the Aberrant setting, and also the most unpredictable. Within the sourcebook we discover just how inhuman and fragmented the Teragen is as an organization. We also find that these are more than inhuman monsters, they are philosopher gods looking for their place in the world, sometimes at the expence of their human identities.The text is presented in a sympathetic light and the authors remind the reader that this is not just a handbook for making a villain, because no one sees themselves as being evil. In the world of Aberrant, there is no black and white only one thick shade of grey.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I was recently given an opportunity to review Therese Heckenkamp's \"Past Suspicion.\" The basic storyline centers around Robin, a 17-year old young adult from upscale California. In the course of the book we discover that Robin's controlling mother dies of cancer, leading to Robin's flight to live with her uncle in small town Wisconsin.Despite knowing nothing about him, Robin develops an interest in her uncle's bookstore and begins working for him. Saving her earnings from the store, Robin hoped to save enough money to return to California. All the while, her uncle is fighting off reporters who want to do a piece on the history of the store. The story centers on the progress of the protagonist in developing and sustaining relationships with others around her. Robin is forced to learn to trust others and live with her actions.Despite my preference for non-fiction, this book offers a suspenseful and interesting story. The entire book was written well - alternating between past and present. I do recommend this book to anyone 12 and up.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"You don't have to be interested in reading celebrity stories to enjoy this book. I highly recommend it.

I found it an easy read and for people new to this process, the very best overview I have read. It is an excellent book to recommend to 'beginners' in unstanding the \"Types\", and the reader can go to other books for more in depth discussions if they choose.

Judging by some of the comments, they obviously didnt read the book. No they didnt have an entourage catering to their every need. They made it clear several times they wanted to ditch the support crew and police escorts and just travel alone. As for the boys whining about things that happened, I'm glad they put it in the book instead of doing a light fluffy feel good piece where every day was wonderful. You're going to have days where things dont go right and you miss your family.Are Ewan & Charley the first 2 to do this kind of trip? No. Have others done bigger or longer trips? Probably. But they never told us they would be doing something thats never been done before. The boys made it clear that the whole trip was about 2 mates having an adventure. The fact that they decided to film it and get someone to fund it is beside the point. If I could get someone to put up the money and the bikes I'd do it too.I have to say, I'm not a big fan of Ewan's movies, and didnt even know who Charley Boorman was before this book and show. But now I'm a big fan of both guys. I found the whole story fun, exciting, moving and at times scary. What I do like about them too is even when they do lose their cool, they're man enough to admit wen they're in the wrong. How many other big stars would have edited the book or tv show to put them in a positive light? How many would even attempt this?I loved the adventure, as well as Long Way Down and By Any Means.

The novel had portions that were extremely clever, the majority of the work was well written, however taken in its entirety was pretty bland. There was enough to keep me reading but when finished I wished I had read something else. There were just enough interesting bits to string together the weaker portions, and that is what kept me plodding forward.I enjoyed the methods the Author employed to show the absurd results that come from the ability to communicate faster, and the exponentially expanding ability we have to create more information. We generate more answers, which increases the time to arrive at a result and delays conclusions, however if the pace is rapid enough and the data that is moved is massive enough, those involved feel it's justified. What it truly is, is absurd. The writer chose the practice of cutting edge medical diagnostics to take the idea of gathering information for its own sake to the ridiculous extreme. While in this book we never learn the fate of the primary character, the idea is implied that while the patient is waiting for the latest results from Star Wars technology, when they finally arrive the patient will be dead.I also enjoyed the implication that the more amazing the technology becomes, the more dependent its users are with the result their competence decreases, and their willingness to make a decision ends in paralysis. If a machine cannot give an answer then the answer does not exist. Specialists carry their own databases, and if there is no match, they exit with dispatch.I did not like the characters in this novel, as most were too pathetic. Even the character that should easily cultivate our sympathy is difficult to care for, as he is already a mess prior to encountering his true challenge. I also felt the link between the effects of drinking Hemlock for Socrates, as a counterpoint to Bill's illness was a stretch that did not work. Trying to rationalize a link between the sons through a similar method lacked any credibility.Some parts were good, but the premise being explored was a variation on a theme and not a new one. That perhaps is what kept this from being a terrific story.","sentiment_score":0.6},{"review":"Despite the fact that I am generally repulsed by the self-help genre, and in particular when they are filled with acronyms that smack of formulaic platitudes, I must admit that this little book was a welcome surprise. There are formulaic acronym chapters but the author does not insult our intelligence with empty promises that make it so simple. He reminds us that changing others is nothing more than manipulation and a losing battle. The only person we can change is ourselves. Mr. Popcak gives us some helpful ways to do just that. And, while giving us those tools, he reminds us how the Christian can fulfill the command to turn the other cheek without turning into a doormat. Many Christian versions of this genre are full of advice for being \"nice\" without a word on boundaries. Others are so intent on stressing boundaries they have little challenge to love our neighbor as we love ourselves. There seems little available that does not fall into one extreme of self-centeredness and the other of false holiness. When they do attempt to bridge that gap, they seldom provide the tools to determine the difference or when one approach applies more appropriately than another. Mr. Popcak, while leaving much to our own common sense, provides us with the bridge and practical tools for crossing that bridge ourselves. His comments are, at times, profoundly simple and direct. But they have a proven track record for the serious Christian wanting to find the balance between loving their neighbor and being their neighbor's doormat. My repulsion of such books has been lessoned discovering this little gem of common sense.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"This is an invaluable resource for anyone wanting to develop a good working knowledge of Urdu. Every aspect of the language that could prove difficult for a beginning student is treated very thoroughly, from pronunciation and script on to the more unfamiliar aspects of Urdu grammar, especially the verb tenses that require agreement of the verb with the gender of the subject (or, sometimes the object!) The framework of the course is a pretend train journey through Pakistan and India by an English doctor named John Smith (yes, really) and his wife, but don't let that put you off. The material in each chapter builds very logically on what has already been introduced, and by the end of the course one has really been well prepared for either more advanced material or conversations with Urdu (and Hindi) speakers. The CD is excellent, as well. Only one minor quibble: larger print for the Urdu script would be a tender mercy, and not just for those of us who have reached our large-print years.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This is a marvelous book.

Except for frequent returns to earlier information, this book is not a &quot;page-turner.&quot; It is, however, a wealth of challenging ideas on how our Neolithic ancestors lived. While North avoids suggesting that Neolithic Europe was unified in religious thinking, he points out areas of commonality. Some form of ancestor worship, he contends, led to sophisticated insight of the heavens across Europe. Over the centuries this knowledge went from star sightings to the recording of positions of the sun and moon at significant times. The evidence for this thesis lies in the burial sites, banks and ditches, wooden and stone monuments dating back nearly seven thousand years.With firm conviction, illustrated by numerous graphic images, North demonstrates how early burial sites acted to mark stellar risings. Neolithic burials took place in a variety of sites: gallery graves, passage graves and dolmens, among others. The prevailing final step was the practice of covering the site with a mound of stones and earth. This could result in long barrows, mounds or other structures, but the one thing they had in common was to elevate the top above the surrounding horizon. Using the surrounding ditch remaining from relocating the soil and rock, observers could note certain stars appearing over an &quot;artificial horizon.&quot; North postulates a possible shift in focus from ancestors and stars to gods or spirits associated with the sun and moon. This &quot;advance&quot; in thinking resulted in stone monuments like Stonehenge in Britain and sites in Western Europe.In tracing the growth of religious thinking and its manifestations in Neolithic Europe, North sees consistency without unity. What he does stress is the advanced thinking that must have been taking place during passing years. Wood and stone circles were positioned with uncanny accuracy to perform their tasks. He provides reconstruction drawings of many of the sites to display the limited fields of view they allowed. Peering along the post alignments, only a brief glimpse of rising or setting sun was available to the observer. Lintels, whether wood or stone, were designed to cut down on glare during sunrise or sunset observations. The graphics illustrating these points require careful study, but are rewarding for that.Some of his contentions seem implausible. He uniformly places observers of stellar risings in ditches. If these were religious leaders, this would seem a diminution of priestly status not seen elsewhere. North has gone to considerable effort to demonstrate just how complex the sites are and what that says about the motivation and abilities of Neolithic peoples. How much of this effort is his, and how much derived from others is difficult to assess. There are frequent references to various authors in the text, but no direct citations. His &quot;Bibliography&quot; is by chapters and too vague to pursue sources without excessive toil. The appendices, on carbon dating, astronomical issues and geographical positioning are helpful, particularly if you have the maths. Overall, this is a useful book, even if it must be read with a sense of caution.

Go to a literary criticism site if you need to be told what someone else thinks of them before you read them yourself. For my part I felt caught up in the action and ran the risk of passing my stop when I read from the book during my commute, so vivid and engrossing did I find the narrative in these tales. Your mileage will certainly vary depending on your tastes, and the sensibilities of an author writing in the late 1920s may offend some.For those searching for background so they can run or play Solomon Kane-themed games, this is your encyclopedia.The book is well made, though I find most of today's paperback covers a bit on the flimsy side. Fortunately there are no \"clever\" marketing ploys like cutouts, so the book sits nicely in the hands and doesn't fight the reader or get snagged on clothing.The cover has a nice color plate depicting the hero, Solomon Kane, and inside there are lavish B&W; illustrations and four full-page B&W; plates produced specially for this volume. The artwork is nice, but positioned oddly in some places, in the middle of the text, forcing the reader to skip over the space taken up by the drawing, often during a tense action sequence. Why the art was placed like this is a mystery, since had it been to one side or the other the text could have flowed much cleaner. I found this distracting and drop a star for it.The text has been \"restored\" by an editorial team, and there are a few pages containing the details of the redactions for the keen collector or scholar of Howard's work.I almost forgot: There is a forward by the illustrator, and a memorial by H.P. Lovecraft written at the time of Howard's death that serves as an introduction of sorts to the book.Even though there is a lot of whitespace in this Trade Paperback (a trait of the format that makes me angry usually) the presence of the artwork makes good use of much of it and at least justifies the otherwise wasted tree. In this volume the whitespace serves to present the text and artwork beautifully (for the most part).All in all an excellent way to get to know Robert E.

I bought the Penguin Popular Classics version of the novel. It is very basic and comes in a simple green cover. It contains no introduction or analysis, just the text plus a very brief historical sketch of Dickens. It seems to be an excellent value for the money and I bought three Dickens novels in the series. I was a bit disappointed in that one book seemed to fall apart as I read it: the binding seemed very weak and cheaply made. It was marginally okay for the present book which is just 400 pages, and the book did not fall apart, but did seem damaged after one read. Another Dickens novel, which was 700 pages long, fell apart with at least 50 pages coming loose. After this bad experience, I bought other versions of Dickens's works - Wordsworth Classic versions and the regular Penguin Classic versions, the ones with the photo on the covers.Charles Dickens, who lived from 1812 to 1870, is the best know male English writer of the 19th century. He authored 22 novels plus numerous short pieces. Most of his writing was first written in serialized form, later published as single novels.A young Dickens at the age of 12 had the unenviable job of attaching labels 10 hours a day at the Warren's boot blacking factory. That experience shaped much of his writing career. Still in his teens he became a law clerk, then later in his twenties a journalist. The last job as a reporter led to the serialized writing of his novels. His works were social commentaries with larger than life characters, or colorful caricatures, living in the slums of London. He was a critic of poverty, social injustice, and the slow moving court system. Those themes permeate most of his novels and it is present her in Great Expectations. This is a novel set in London and the countryside close to London. It is a story of a young boy who wants to grow up and become wealthy and to be a gentleman. Those are his \"great expectations.\"Without giving away critical plot elements, it is the story of a young boy called Pip, whose parents are dead, and who lives with his sister and her husband Jo who is a blacksmith. They want Pip to learn the trade and be a blacksmith as well. They live in a small town near marshlands near London. His ambitions are grander and he wants to escape to London and become a gentleman. Will Pip find happiness? Will he succeed? Action shifts back and forth between the small town where Pip first lived and the city of London. It involves Pip, lawyers, accountants, Pip's new friends, his love interest, etc.The novel is not used by Dickens for any pressing social issues, although one might argue that it shows how Pip's ambition blinds him to his true friends. But mostly it is pure entertainment. The book is a classic but has a choppy feel that one can attribute to the way it was written. It was written as a series of dramatic stories for popular serialization which were then combined to make a single novel. I enjoyed the read and would highly recommend the book.Having read 10 of Dickens's novels I still rate David Copperfield as best, and ahead of the present book, both as a work of literature and for entertainment value. In many ways the two novels are similar, but the plot is far more interesting and realistic in David Copperfield, and Dickens has many more interesting characters in that book, and as a bonus it is almost twice as long.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"In &quot;Elfi's World&quot;, Edelgard Knoob transports us to the wondrous time and place of her childhood in Germany.

A famous cricket player dies in a suspicious fire, and New Scotland Yard's investigation is complicated by the professional jealousy of the local constabulary. The suspects include the dead man's not-quite-ex-wife, his angry teen-age son, his lover (who has conveniently gone missing), her former lover, and at least three other people whose motives and relationships are too complex to be so neatly summarized. What these diverse characters have in common is their distastefulness-they are by far the most unpleasant group of people assembled in any of Elizabeth George's novels, and most of them have the foulest mouths, as well. In a departure from the style of the previous Inspector Lynley mysteries, George uses first-person narrative for some of the chapters, in the form of a journal kept by one of the characters. Although this device turns out to have a purpose, the narrator is an extremely unsympathetic figure who tries the reader's patience before the strands of the plot are connected. Meanwhile, Inspector Lynley clashes with his superiors and has new misunderstandings with Lady Helen Clyde, while Sergeant Barbara Havers moves into a new apartment. There are a great many details that suggest this installment could have used a little more careful editing. For example, the issues that Lynley and Helen quarrel about seem forced and artificial, and it is very hard to believe that a detective sergeant's salary doesn't allow for a new refrigerator. In sum, a disappointing downturn from the quality of the rest of the series.","sentiment_score":0.6},{"review":"Yes, surprise of the decade, a genuine modern epic novel has been published! With the eerie resonance of Grossman's classic &quot;Life and Fate&quot;, Stroyar depicts the destruction of the individual soul (then its rebirth) against background of an alternate-history which has Nazi Germany victorious in WW II and ruling most of Europe with the application of its hideous racial and dehumanizing policies.

However, further problems in West Virginia postpone Owen's trip to the West Coast.The dam by the Canaan II mine erupts, killing four and filling DRYBONE HOLLOW with coal sludge. Owner Anson Stoke hires Owen to persuade environmentalist Judge Carter Vereen that despite the toll, his operations remain safe and should stay open. Judge Vereen orders an investigation of all impoundment dams sitting on mines, which leads to state attorney general Hayes Boyer asking Owen to head the inquiry, but demanding a kickback of 15% of Owen's fee. Owen rejects the offer, but turns to his friend Sheriff Thad Reader to set a trap to expose those using fixed contracts, but the law enforcement official deals with a full plate already as a local has probably been abducted. So Owen plunges ahead knowing he will receive limited support from his buddy, but mine engineer Emily Kruk makes it worth while to stay in West Virginia a bit longer.Though the \"will he reconcile or not\" becomes a bit annoying, readers will appreciate the latest Owen Allison investigative tale. Most of the audience will kick themselves when they see how obvious John Billheimer's plot solves the mystery as the clues are all provided, but so devilishly done that most fans (including this sore reviewer) will fail to see it. The cast is a delight with the hero at his best when he investigates.Harriet Klausner","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"A beautiful collection of stories from the hospital world.

J. Tracy.STORY BRIEF:Monkeewrench is the name of a software company that creates computer games. There are five partners. Ten years ago something happened that caused all of them to change their names, move to Minnesota, live in secured homes, and carry guns. Their new game, just released, is about a serial killer with twenty crime scenes. A real life serial killer has just killed two people and left the crime scenes exactly the same as the first two murders in the game.The book opens with an elderly couple killed and mutilated while sitting in a church in Wisconsin. The reader suspects there is a connection between the Wisconsin and Minnesota murders.REVIEWER'S OPINION:This book was recommended to me by a minister's wife. There are a few religious symbols and ideas which I suspect delighted her. Although I am surprised that she didn't complain about the volume of vulgar and religious swear words.This is a long and complicated process of slowly uncovering clues about a killer. It kept my interest. There's a curiosity urgency of when are you going to call this guy, or when are you going to figure this out. There is no suspense other than during the final climactic scene with the killer.There wasn't much police work or evidence. It was mostly conversation and speculation. And then in the ending climax, the killer explains everything in a ten minute monologue. I would have preferred learning motivations and evidence along the way rather than have the killer tell all at the end. I also would have preferred some cool police work or investigating.I was annoyed with three stupidities during the ending climax. A cop did something stupid. The good guys were stupid to split up. And then a good guy did something stupid. It's the kind of thing that's typical and overdone. It reminded me of made-for-TV-movies. I would have preferred something different - unusual - unexpected.I would have liked more showing of how the killer lured victims, talked to them, killed them, and then got away - especially the one in the store. I had a hard time figuring out how the killer could do what was done without a store clerk seeing something suspicious.Straight mysteries are not my first choice in reading. But I enjoy them if there is something special, unique, or fun. This did not hit me that way.I have never loved a book that was written by two people. But I try to be open to it. This book was written by a mother and daughter team.NARRATOR:I'm sorry but I did not like the narrator's accent. I'm used to and prefer generic TV anchor speak. The narrator Buck Schirner used a long e sound instead of a short i. For example: detecteev, talkateev, collecteev, Wednesdeey, hees (his), heem (him).DATA:Unabridged audiobook reading time: 11 hrs and 12 mins. Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words. Sexual content: none. Setting: current day Minnesota and Wisconsin. Book copyright: 2003. Genre: murder mystery.

And each chapter introduces a Jewish hero (or heroine), beginning with cavemen nearly 10,000 years ago. With each age, the Jewish religion develops further, and survives another attack from competing cultures, including those of the Cananites (2200 B.C.), Babylonians (605 B.C), Muslims (635 A.D.), Crusaders (1099 A.D.), and Turks (1880 A.D.).The most interesting character of the book is God, whose presence is portrayed through recurring character traits of the persons who live and die at Makor. \"The Source,\" is both a town and, indeed, the source of religion.This book was written many years before I was born, so don't worry that it is out of fashion.

She went against the conventions of her times (the early 20th Century), and lived life on her own terms. Fiercely independent and brave, Emily traveled alone to the Western Coast of Canada to paint Native American totem poles. She felt strongly that these poles were a \"memorial of her country's first greatness\", and a record of these poles needed to be made before they were all gone. Eventually, her paintings became more than just a record, as she looked to express in her work the spirit of the subject she was painting.This book is beautifully written, and the characters are very well developed. Particularly, I really enjoyed the way that Susan Vreeland described the paint colors Emily applied to her canvas. These very visual descriptions really help to emphasize the value and importance Emily placed on color in her work. I also really loved the way that Emily was always looking for the spirit or meaning in her work.I found this book to be very inspiring, and I am very grateful to Susan Vreeland for introducing me to the world of Emily Carr.

In writing this book they have placed in the reader's hands a simple yet powerful guide for their fellow human beings who either are or may in the future be facing similar odds. It is a well written, honest, and inspiring little book about a miracle.Susan and Denny's nine-year-old son John was the victim of an accidental traumatic burning in 1987, a trauma even more sad as it was the result of John's playful games with fire and gasoline! Despite severe burns over most of his body John survived (a true medical phenomenon!) due to the expert care of the medical staff attending him, the support from his caring family, the generosity and kindness of his extended family and friends, and from John's own will to live and become normal again. The diary covers 17 years of trials responding to the O'Leary's indefatigable faith and ends with an epilogue written by John himself. If ever there were a modern day re-telling of the story of Job, this little book would qualify.Often little memoirs such as OVERWHELMING ODDS are written in the passion of reaction to a shattering event and the quality of the prose is at times a stumbling block to the final effect of the message. Not so with this book: the writing is sensitive, terse, to the point, and while there are significant religious overtones, the message remains one of the triumph of the indomitable human spirit. It is a fine little book to read and to share with friends who may be facing crises. It is an inspirational diary.

In many ways, the book reads like a traditional sci-fi novel, telling of the rise of a species of giant lizards and its eventual conflict with mankind. However, several things set it apart from the rest of its genre.For one thing, though there are four or five notable characters in the book, you never really see any of them for more than about four chapters. The main players in the novel are not individual people but countries; much of the book is written from a global perspective, in terms of the reactions of countries, societies, and the whole world as they are introduced to the newts.The book is also notable for its humor. The dry, subtle gibes give the work a similar feel to the novels of British author Terry Pratchett. The comedy comes not only from the tone of the writing style itself, but also in the form of the characters (both individual and regional), whose slightly ridiculous portrayal makes them seem quite human indeed, just like any one of us.The book is not merely for sci-fi enthusiasts. The reactions to the newts - human, economic, political, and otherwise - are chillingly familiar. In them we see accurate reflections of current and past social climates. This novel is equally valuable from a sociological perspective, or even as an insight into human nature itself. In this grim view of the future, we see our own past and present.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"As with his last four or five books, Sheldon wastes his innovative mind on shlock, presumably so he can churn out books faster and reap the reward$.

My advice to Sheldon is to take a few extra minutes\/hours\/days\/weeks\/months to develop his books, or he'll have at least one less reader.","sentiment_score":0.2},{"review":"Princess Abigail is a lovely woman suffering from her father's eccentricity. He is so obsessed with hats (which he wears instead of crowns) that he has promised to marry Abigail off to the first prince who presents the best hat. When her father finally agrees to give her to an unbelievably ugly prince, she flees the castle that very night in despair and vanishes into the forest. It is in the heart of the dark woods that she finds an unexpected source of escape.If this plot doesn't sound familiar to you, it's because it isn't; this is a completely original tale for children to enjoy. The illustrations are possibly the strongest point; gorgeous, rich colors that dazzle the eyes and strengthen the tone of the tale. Abigail herself is as original as the story: she is a striking, almost spitting image of Helena-Bonham Carter and her unusual beauty adds to the dramatic affect of her character.While the tale and the pictures are enchanting, there is one major fault that I found offensive in the story: remember when I said Abigail flees the night before her wedding? She doesn't just run away because it's an arranged marriage, but because her fiance is ugly. Even worse, when her father first declares the prince to be her fiance, she screams \"I'd rather die than marry such a prince!\" right in front of the poor guy, bursts into tears, and leaves the room. Granted, he WAS ugly (unrealistically so, in fact), but this in no way excuses her cruel treatment of him. If I were in the prince's place, I would have dropped the spoiled brat like a ton of bricks!The book in no way condemns her actions at any point; just treats the prince like he's the problem in the plot without developing his character. What kind of message does this send children? I know what it's like to be called ugly by the opposite sex and it's a very hurtful experience, especially for a young child. If you buy this for your children, please read it with them to ensure that they understand her actions were wrong. Other than this shallow flaw in the heroine, I recommend the book.

Great literature does the same, but with the description, it capably details broader concepts and greater concepts.This book revolves around Stephen Dedalus, but really tells us about the Ireland of his time. Stephen is almost unanimously known to be the author. Joyce's depiction of his emotional and intellectual growth - preteen, teen and young man - paints a broad picture of Ireland - at least Joyce's Ireland. His Irish Catholic Ireland, where issues compound over religion, language and rite. He is confused as he questions the unquestionable -- Catholic religion's centuries-old traditions. And, his questions are eloquently asked on the pages of this novel.One friend of Stephen comments on this young man's realization of possible non-belief in religion: \"It is a curious thing ... how your mind is supersaturated with religion in which you say you disbelieve.\" And, so this may accurately depict Ireland's strange and hypocritical relationship with the Roman Catholic Church.And, this book is chock full of Catholic quotations, recitations, and references. So much so, that my Penguin edition of this novel immensely aided me with its extensive endnotes (over 600 in total) describing the words (sometimes archaic or colloquial) and often describes people (often Irish history's leaders for or against the Catholic Church) or statements (often relating to the Bible). I highly recommend that all readers get such edition or a similar publication as the nearly 100-year gap in time and continent's division have made many passages herein obscure to modern American readers.As much as Stephan is confused about religion, he is confused about Ireland - not surprising as much of Ireland's confusions stem from religion. At one time, young Stephen says, \"Do you know what Ireland is?. . . Ireland is the old sow that eats her farrow.\" Of course, this a curt response made impulsively in discussion when men are tired, inebriated, or both. But, it probably reflects what others felt, what others thought, and what others publicly proclaimed. Note: most of the other provisions regarding Ireland show pride - immense pride.Joyce admits Ireland had its faults. Inequitable and overly cruel torture placed upon the parochial students is described in detail. Religious zealots overstated their arguments to audiences too young to receive such extreme philosophy. Chapter III's amazingly well written speech of purgatory can only be deemed as provocative and funny. The humor comes from teenage Stephan's response: \"thinking of sin\" is a sin; and committing any one sin is the equivalent to committing all of the sins; and committing one sin is enough to prevent anyone from being free of purgatory. Hence, little Stephen concludes that his lustful thoughts of a girl guaranteed purgatory. He was a marked man. Then he goes to a confessional and discovers there are exceptions to the rule promulgated in the lecture. Catholicism, he discovers, is laden with exceptions to the rules. Grey lines, not black lines, define acceptable behavior. To a teenager this is perplexing, to the young man this is blasphemy.Incredibly insightful. Incredibly long lasting. Amazingly applicable to even today's Ireland. This book has lasted for decades for these reasons.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Third book in the Pascal Trilogy, which is author Katherine Kingsley's most popular series. The second bk in the series - No Sweeter Heaven - is the most famous, and probably the best, story in the series. I read No Sweeter Heaven 15 years ago and reading NBD, I am reminded of all the things I liked and disliked about KK's writing.This novel features the only son of the H\/H from No Sweeter Heaven and, if I include the Prologue, it covers a period of 16 years. It starts with 14 year old Andre vowing to love his childhood sweetheart forever and ever. When his sweetheart dies, Andre turns his back on God, his family, and his country, and roams all over Ancient Asia Minor writing history books.In Turkey, he comes across a sick urchin, Ali, and nurses her back to health. After she recovers, Andre keeps Ali as his servant, thinking she is a 12 yr old boy. Ali helps to alleviate the heaviness in Andre's heart with her laughter, her chattering, her intelligence, and her thirst for life. When Ali is discovered to be the long-lost daughter of Andre's mentor, he sends her away to England to be with her relatives because it is the right thing to do.Ali, who grew up thinking she was Turkish and Muslim, deals with the culture shock of Victorian England. She meets with the H\/Hs of the previous 2 books. She learns English and all the accomplishments of a proper English lady. But mostly, she waits for Andre to come back to England because she knows she is meant to be his wife.KK is known for the spiritual and otherworldy elements in her books. Spiritual faith is an important theme in this trilogy. I have never read an inspirational or christian romance so I dont know how this would compare but I would not call KK's tone preachy or zealous.NBD is about 380 pages but it read like 450. It is a visceral read. I laughed. I teared up. I felt like I was put through the wringer. The prose is clean, but evocative. At times, it reminded of Patricia Gaffney (the Gaffney who wrote Wild at Heart and To Love and Cherish). KK and Gaffney both wrote for the same imprint (Topaz) during 1990s as well as many other excellent authors like Mary Jo Putney. I suggest that if you liked the Gaffney books I mentioned as well as some of the more New Age-y historicals of Putney, then you might want to give this trilogy a try.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"My mom was born in Southern Germany just before the war started.

So much more than the movie, with additional detail and real perspective on the characters. Those overwraught emotions make so much more sense after reading the book! Although there is a rich historical background in this novel, it's really about one woman's struggle against herself, her time, and her enemies.I also really enjoyed the narrator of this audio book. She did a wonderful job of bringing the story alive and giving depth to the different characters (with different voices and inflections) and had a wonderful way of telling the story.If you are a fan of GWTW the movie and have never read the book, I urge you to get out there and find a copy. You won't be disappointed with this rich historical drama.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I was given this book by my sewing teaching when I was wee lass.

I enjoyed Krause's writing of being in the wild and learning techniques to record sounds. He shares significant insights from his experiences. He writes as someone who has truly fallen in love with the wild and its music. He does not write as an unreasonable fanatic who exalts nature above souls, but he sees nature and the souls of humans as part of the God's creation and symbiotic. I appreciated his gentle, respectful tone throughout the book. His passion is conveyed in his writing and so is his sorrow over the destruction of so many of the environments where he recorded. This book really gave me a better understanding of the value and richness of nature, and the cd recordings can't be beat.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"All the Heartland books are AWESOME. I am now doing a book report on the first three, maybe four if I can get Taking Chances in time. If you haven't read these books before, they are about a fifteen year old girl, Amy Fleming, who has had a tough life yet has persevered through it. In the first book, Amy brings her mother out in a storm to resuce a horse who was abandoned by his owners. After they get Spartan in the trailer and are heading back, a tree hits their truck, killing her mom. In the rest of the books, you learn how Amy copes with her moms work, healing horses, saving Heartland, putting up with her sister, Lou, and stopping Ty from leaving after so long.

Consequently, I read his account of his bout with cancer as soon as it came out in 1974.I have just reread this book. I strongly recommend it, not only for its high readability and the intrinsic interest of Alsop's life and work, but mainly because of its unique perspective: that of a man who knows himself to be dying - though, ironically, no one seems to be sure what, exactly, he is dying of. Alsop is unusually articulate in relating his experience. Reading his book, this reader gets a glimpse of what the process of dying might actually feel like.Alsop never stoops to a maudlin sentimentalism. Instead, he aims for a kind of psychological distance throughout, and, essentially, he succeeds. I wish someone had written an epilogue to this book; since when it ends, you are left wondering about when and how death finally caught up with him. I now know that it happened in May 1974.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I'm a former Nordstrom employee. There are a few things wrong right off the bat with the book: the employee manual is not just one page anymore. Second, the book only examines the pros of Nordstrom. There are a few notations of \"competition\" but Spector and McCarthy do not examine the reality of cut throat competition on the sales floor. Depending on the management of the store, it can be either harnessed or turned negative. Some of the team examples no longer exist (like nominating employees for recognition). Too much is left to independent departmen managers: and many lack formal training. A good manager may or may not be a good sales person but that is how Nordstrom promotes. I do agree that customer service (be it the sales staff, the buyers, or actual cutomers) is critical in any role but there is little examination of the culture of Nordstrom that can make it a good learning experience but not a good career trajectory.Spector and McCarthy seem a bit reluctant to take of some of the shine of the silver bagged company: it's too bad. There is a lot of good information for early career types or sales managers but there is a lot of Kool Aid. And don't believe all the heroic tales in the book: it's a problem for Nordstrom employees.

I was also glad to see Cussler wrote hiimself into the story again -- I had missed &quot;seeing&quot; him in the last couple of novels. And I'm very glad he's gone bakc to writing his novels himself without any poetic help. The thesis of this book, which includes Atlantean mythology combined with genetic engineering, is quite interesting and once again Cussler's imagination brings us to imagine the &quot;what if?&quot; in a story. Of course Dirk and Al survive every trap, setback,injury and diabolical plot and manage to save the day, but one expects no less from them or Cussler.

Stevenson's lovingly applied detail in describing people, places and things sucks the reader in immediately, and you'll stick around to experience one of the finest narratives in all of sailing literature.It is thus unsurprising that Treasure Island's somewhat visual style inspired several similar stories, mostly films. When I first read it, it reminded me of Indiana Jones 4 mixed with Pirates of the Caribbean and a tiny pinch of the Cohen Brother's True Grit adaption. You can sometimes feel the dry humor of the original Office in there too.The plot involves an old sea dog taking residence in an inn in England, trying and failing to escape his old pirate shipmates, who want the treasure map he has. He dies of alcohol poisoning, and the map is taken by Jim Hawkins, who was owed money by the deceased sailor. Jim and his friends use the map to find an island where pirate gold awaits. The story sounds hokey on paper, but in reality this is the mother of all pirate stories, and it's execution is so flawless any disbelief is quickly and forcefully cast aside.Treasure Island is much about its characters. There are quite a few of them, and Stevenson manages to juggle them successfully and keep all the balls in the air, if you will. There's a few humorous exchanges from Dr. Livesy and Squire Trewalny, who bicker like Holmes and Watson in Sign of Four; there's of course the infamous rogue Silver, who starts off as a cheery cook only to turn the tables and start hunting for our hero's blood. But the real star of the book is Jim Hawkins, an intelligent young boy (probably about 10-12 years old) who narrates the story and carries it along. Jim is somehow simultaneously funny, smart and a little complicated, a lot like Indiana Jones. In certain scenes, however, he displays moments of self-centered eccentricity, which do wonders to humanize him.In film adaption and sequels, Jim is often overshadowed by Silver (who, to be fair, is also an interesting character). This isn't true to the spirit of Treasure Island, however, as Jim is largely the star character and rightfully so. He deserves his place next to Jack Sparrow and Indiana Jones as one of the greatest characters to wear a good hat and go treasure hunting.

This novel, written in the first person, presents the life of a peasant woman living in a remote Hindu village in India. Since the village is never named nor is a year ever mentioned in the book, a number of commenters have suggested that the book represents the story of India herself, arising out of feudalism and through industrialization. One of the characters is an English physician, Kennington (called Kenny by the narrator), who often appears to exhibit compassion for the people yet continues to fail to understand them or their culture (nor does he ever appear to make a serious effort to learn). This is a criticism many have given toward the British rule of India. The book begins with the narrator, Rukmani, at an old age and near death. She begins her story with her wedding. She was the third daughter of a village head and, at the age of twelve, is married off to a tenant rice farmer named Nathan. Through births, deaths, prosperous times, and devastating times (such as times of famine and when they lose their farm and are forced to travel to the city with nothing to call their own), she and Nathan remain close and truly bonded together. Even at the time of her own death approaching, she still sees him (her husband had passed away earlier); he has never left her. The book also illustrates the importance of family and the support one should always get from family. It is an uplifting history of a poor, but intelligent, honest, and noble Indian woman.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I read this years ago and then gave it away so this was a replacement.

Lewis is that he is able to incorporate a sense of the mystical and magical with the form of the world in a Christian framework without either aspect becoming forced or stilted. The stories that Lewis has crafted in the Chronicles of Narnia stand on their own as good storytelling even without the underpinning of Christian imagery - they are strong tales, kin in many ways to the Lord of the Rings cycle, which makes sense, given the friendship and professional relationship of Lewis with Tolkein.This particular text, 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', is the second installment in the overall Narnia series, but each story is able to stand on its own. This is a story that almost begins with 'once upon a time...' It is a good story for children of all ages (including 40-year-old children like me). The story begins in the dark days of the London blitz, with the children being sent away for their protection. This was common for people in all social classes, from the royal family on down, to send the children out to the countryside for the duration of the war - when Lewis was writing and publishing the Narnia books, this experience would have been fresh in the minds of the readers. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are the family children sent to stay with old Professor and his less-than-amiable housekeeper; it comes as no surprise that the children hope to escape from this as much as from the bombs in London, and escape they did.Lucy found it first - the portal to Narnia, in the back of the wardrobe in the special room. Then Edmund (though he would lie about it), and then all four make the journey into Narnia, where they discover themselves to be the likely heirs of a prophetic chain of events freeing the land from the evil of the wintery White Witch, who was then styling herself as the Queen of Narnia. In fact, the real king of Narnia was Aslan, a majestic lion full of power and grace, whose soul was as pure as any child's hope for the future.The Christian images would seem familiar to any liturgical churchgoer, but the there are also other symbols that fit beyond the religious that tap into deeper longings - evil here is not a hot place, but a frozen place, where the emotions are cold and sharp. The lesser creatures are the virtuous ones, and the children lead the way to the redemption of all. The battle of good and evil takes place in epic form, fitting many forms of heroic tales. The lion Aslan stands for the Christ figure, but can also conjure images of the lion of England - Peter's shield with a red lion makes him both the stand-in for the first of the apostles as well as a perfect casting for St. George. Other parallels abound.The children themselves live a good life in Narnia, but eventually return to their English countryside encampment, with spirits and hopefulness renewed.This is a tale of extraordinary power, and one that stays with the reader for a long time. Long before Harry Potter, there was Narnia - a tale that is not only fun and riveting, but also one with a strong moral lens that includes not only power, but the giving up of power; not only victory, but also forgiveness and sacrifice. Revenge is an emotion that is defeated here, and good triumphs at the last.A grand story, and a great film!","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"\"Life is change, and simplicity had been swept away on a Roman floodtide.\"Morgan Llywelyn's Druids is the story of the eradication of free Gaul by the Roman general Julius Caesar. It takes place in what would someday be called France during the first century before the Christian era. The Chief Druid is the \"soul friend\" of the great Gaulish leader Vercingetorix, whose skepticism about Druid magic is an ever present division between the two men. Ultimately, however, neither might nor magic can stop the flood tide of the Romans' technology and discipline. The entire society based on the druidical earth religion is fated to be squeezed ever north and west and ultimately blotted out by Christianity.Llywelyn's plot is subtle, though you don't notice that at first. Romans are a threat on the border when the tale begins, becoming more ruthless and more immediate as it develops. The Gauls at first are willing to let Rome in the backdoor in exchange for the luxuries traders bring in, but the Roman genera's best ally is the inability of the Gauls to work together to present a unified resistance. This is partly their tradition but also in reaction to brutality of Roman retribution for \"rebellion\". Vercingetorix and his Druid seek to remedy this, and here's where the subtlety sneaks in, for they start to adopt Roman discipline, tactics and technology in order to defeat the Romans, surrendering their unique identity quite voluntarily.In Ann Parson's Mystery Book Discussion group recently we talked about whether you can like a book without liking a main character. I can categorically affirm that you can, as I really rather detested the narrator, the Chief Druid. I rather wish the main character had been Vercingetorix, but that is the author's decision. I know she had her reasons. I felt cheated on Vercingetorix's part as he loses all while the narrator simply retires into the woods with his three wives. I know he lost much more, but if he believed his own view of death, that it is a short phase in life, he definitely made out much better than his friend, whom he annoyingly calls \"Rix\".The novel itself also sneaks up on you. I almost hit the off button a few times early in the book, finding myself not enjoying it as much as I have other Llywelyn's. But I stayed with it and am glad I did. There is a sweet bit of information revealed in the brief author's note at the end that tickled me and would not have come as any sort of surprise to the Chief Druid that you will just have to learn for yourself.From That's All She Read http:\/\/allsheread.blogspot.com","sentiment_score":0.6},{"review":"This story is not really about life on another planet, but on how the idea of life (Once it's confirmed and not just a vague idea) on another planet will affect our global society.

She forgets but rings after about 30 minutes then proceeds to prepare for bed. She hears a noise and discovers Connel has let himself into her home. He claimed that he knocked but no one answered so that meant come on in!!! Then he demands to be fed, dry clothes, shower, etc. This is a STRANGER . . . HELLO!! What does Zoe says blah, blah, blah, you are an uninvited guest in my home but I will take care of you. Connel fixes a meal, does his laundry and yaks with Zoe, who apparently feels comfortable enough with this stranger who has invited himself into her home to fall asleep. The next day she finds herself in her bed and she is undressed. The nerve of this guy!! Heck Zoe isn't much better as she let him get away with it and didn't even call the police.The book carries on in that vein. There really is no thoughts of Connel's in this story so we don't know why he is in the area - he never says, why he seems to know so much about Zoe -other than the bad mouthing that his cousin has told him, why he would even be interested and why Zoe's brother-in-law and sister think that Zoe should bend over backwards to please Connel. What planet do these people exist on? Then there is another woman in the book but we aren't really sure what that angle is either as Connel doesn't explain but he does put this woman's needs above whatever it was that he was going to spout off to Zoe at the party which by the way he invited her to last minute. Like the day of the party!!There didn't seem to be any chemistry between Connel and Zoe nor could I understand how they could fall in love with each other.

It didn't make much sense when even her own sister complains that Zoe spends too much time working and not enough doing other things.

Ahab(man), crazed by the injury caused by the Whale(God), his whole life reduced to the manic pursuit of that which eludes him. What a stirring metaphor. What a grand, operatic, messy, sometimes-overwritten, yet never boring novel. Great works are not perfect. Their very imperfection renders them great, for in the attempt at the sublime, the metaphysical, the ALL, they achieve an awe that stills the soul. And in the end, we have Ahab, glorious Ahab, unbowed, enraged, shouting his impotent rage at the Whale, as his life is swallowed away. Who's listening?

Wolfe, with the help of Archie, Saul, Orrie, and others in the crew, must investigate the murder of a fashion model who died by eating candy from a box of poisoned chocolates.

She's given us a first-person narrative of a sociopathic murderer and has actually had us pulling for him to get away with his crimes.Tom Ripley is sent to Europe to persuade an old school friend, Dickie Greenleaf, to return home and work in the family business. However, for the first time in his life Tom gets a taste of the good life and the freedom that money can buy. He comes up with an audacious plan to assume Dickie Greenleaf's life and trust fund. One murder leads to another as Tom scrambles to keep up the deception. But through all of this the reader actually feels sympathy for Tom and wants him to succeed.I recommend this book highly. Ms. Highsmith is a good writer and the way she makes this difficult theme work is nothing short of masterful.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I really like this book because it gives one a great overview of each president.

Interestingly enough, outside of the cover picture, my favorite picture is of &quot;her future husband&quot; the day they met, and the look in his eyes as he looks towards her. The fact that he is completely oblivious to the camera, is so revealing of his feelings about her, considering she was at her highest weight. It is wonderful that she met someone before her surgery, that came to love her unconditionally. Reading her story was quite informative of the personal aspects of this issue.

Both are viewed as his most complete artistic visions; and both are in the enviable position of being on the Modern Libraries list of the 100 best pieces of fiction of the twentieth century.Gatsby is gorgeously written, and the language is expressive, nuanced, and multi-leveled. One can read and re-read Gatsby and find new things with each reading. A better definition of a classic I cannot find. Gatsby is also a radically economical novel. Coming in at just 50,000 words, it is nearly a novella. A short book, it seems long due to its reputation and genius. But in the end, it is petite, and Fitzgerald had to work within the confines of this short narrative structure.Not so with Tender is the Night. At 108,000 words, the novel allows Fitzgerald to sprawl; in the course of the novel, we see far less compressed development of the characters than in Gatsby. There are far more graphic representations of scene, the flow of time, and the outcome of events. Tender shows the reader how good Fitzgerald could be in a longer form. He stretches his wings, and the results are astonishing. It is a moving and tragic novel of love and life gone astray.Even with some of the novel's problems (does the text really give us enough of Nichole's insanity? Is Dick Diver's descent given enough grounding) Tender is the perfect accompaniment to Gatsby and Gatsby to Tender. For writers, it shows that if lighting does not exactly strike twice, similar results can be produced by and expressed by the same electric charge.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I picked this up just after Christmas because I wanted to re-read \"A Christmas Carol.\" The two additional stories, \"The Chimes\" and \"The Cricket on the Hearth,\" were new to me although I've read nearly all of the Dickens novels.

The articles are actually about things that went down at the middle and end of the 1990s-- even though the paperback was published in 2007-- but the events are the most controversial of that time period (and hence easy to remember). The book is also very New York City heavy-- and that's a good thing. It may yet be possible that the whole US will not descend into the stupidity of New York City and that the rot will just remain local (I hope so, otherwise I can't see a future for the country).Good points:1. A lot of books by liberals spend a lot of time talking about what should or what might be. But this book deals with what ACTUALLY HAPPENS. People such as Susan Sarandon\/ Bruce Springsteen (\"41 shots\") have opinions about everything-- and write songs about those opinions, too. But they can't be bothered to get their facts straight. The antidote to incorrect information is correct information, and this book provides that in abundance.2. Lots of intellectuals whine about how it is a \"moral obligation\" to do this or that. But they don't study what actually happens in the cases where the government does try to get involved.3. I could have done with a chapter about WHY intellectuals\/ entertainers have the ideas that they do. The lack of such a chapter did not diminish the book, but the author's thoughts are so interesting that I would like to have read them just the same.4. The writing was very light and easy to read. It went by very fast. The information was very dense, and a reread of the first 100 pages (or every chapter) might be in order to come to grips with the sheer volume of the information.5. MacDonald makes a very clear demonstration of how certain elements of the media will turn reality on its head (i.e., the New York Times) for their own purposes. And in each case, her assertions are backed up with evidence and numbers and not just ipse dixit assertions.This is a great book, and the low cost (nothing other than the paper that it takes to print it up) makes it required reading.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Ever wonder what it might be like to be in battle?

Sienkiewicz (an author unknown to me before discovering Quo Vadis) creates an extraordinarily detailed and vivid spiritual and psychological landscape of 1st cent Rome, both pagan and Christian. With a story line that grips the attention and keeps the pages turning, one meets Nero and several of the members of his vast, opulent household, the ruling class of Rome, dripping with unthinkable excess, decadence, intrigue and vacuity: lives despairing of meaning and transcendence, self-medicated with sensuality. And then you meet the followers of the new and strange religion, grossly misunderstood and mistrusted, and you begin to enter their secret lives and to understand them too. The followers of one they call Christ live in the same time and place - but in a completely different world, a world known by hope in a Kingdom infinitely greater than that \"beautiful\" one built by \"the divine\" Nero.In the novel, these two worlds collide with cataclysmic results. Externally, of course, we witness the gut-wrenching persecution of the Christians. But Sienkiewicz soars far higher as he opens the mind and heart of the reader to the internal conflict that this collision of worlds creates: the variety of responses in the persecutors ranging from heart-hardening indifference or even enthusiastic amusement and blood-lust to an awakening of conscience, a glimpse of the eternal and sometimes even to conversion. But even more poignant is the challenge to the persecuted: the temptation to despair, to disillusionment, the pleading prayer for deliverance, the self-abandonment in hope to the promises of Christ, and, finally, the supernatural gift of forgiveness and love that is at the heart of this new faith, a faith that is gently flowering in the hard, cruel soil of the ancient Pagan world. And it is, indeed, a faith that can only survive the darkness by a total and miraculous self-giving of love, both human and divine.In short, one meets real men and women in Quo Vadis, struggling with the most real and fundamental conflicts of human life. And though the story is set long ago in a land (for most of us) far away, the struggle it addresses is perennial because it is, recognized or not, the spiritual struggle of every human soul.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"In this most famous Remarque novel, we follow the life of Paul Baumer, a young German soldier in WWI, to his tragic death.We can see the dissonance between the romaticized version of war, which is taught to him by a high school teacher, and the actual situation of war, where in one case people are just waiting for a soldier to die to take his boots from him.The author does a very good job intertwining nature, as seen from the trenches, to the savage brutality of the combat going on. It is difficult to give good examples that don't sound corny here, but trust me that the author puts these references in a way that the reader gets a complete image of the situation.The war is seen away from its political or military environment, but rather from the perspective of daily deaths, without much meaning or crying. There is some gore, but it is done well, to the point that it will make the reader finch and understand the conditions.In this meaningless world of war, the ending is fitting.

At the start of the book we once again find Harry hating life with his muggle aunt & uncle and eagerly looking forward to the start of the school year when he can return to Hogwarts. The book introduces us to several new characters including a new Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin and a Divination professor.

This classic work attempts to trace the sequence of continuous creation by logical deduction with reference to the law of cause & effect. It is important to bear in mind the triumph of principle over precedent, meaning that ideas become manifest despite the absence of past experience, as in the case of the development of aviation. Troward conveys profound concepts with clarity; no knowledge of theological terminology is required. He encourages the reader to contemplate these ideas and assimilate them if they help to makethe meaning of the Bibleclearer.Troward calls the creative process the Self-contemplation of Spirit. The twofold essence of nature comprises (i) the unity of a universal creative principle & (ii) multiplicity in manifestation. He posits a sequence of cause & effect universal in nature that harmoniously includes all possible variations of individual expression. Two factors are projected from a common source: individual consciousness and energy-matter. Their relation to each other becomes an absolute fact regarding these factors themselves. The cosmos is thus no illusion. Creation proceeds from the operation of Divine Will upon both the \"soul\" of nature (in a sequence of progressive condensation) and the localization of its mind in the individual.The author identifies the substantive properties of Spirit as love, light, power, peace, beauty & joy and its actions as initiative & selection. If Love itself is the original motive for creation, the divine ideal is that of individuality that recognizes its source. The need for a standard of personality becomes essential owing to matters of resonance &harmony. Taking the nature of Divine Spirit as blueprint is the way; this must be done by individual choice & free will. Alternatives like the personal force of will, magical rites, affliction of the body or the invocation of spirits deny the Eternal.The transition from the collective operation of the Creative Spirit on mankind to its specific operation on the individual corresponds to the concept of theoctave. Choosing the personality pattern of the Source means selecting the eternal essence and being of life itself. This requires the rejection of the species-standard and embracing the Spirit standard that enables the localized consciousness to grow with theThe Eternal Divinethrough communication & action.The will of God is Life according toScripture& common sense. Rejoicing in the life of the Spirit establishes reciprocity of reflection - the law of action and reaction. The initiative to interact with & relate individually to the Creator springs from a yearning of the heart. When realized it enriches the individual personality by an endless flow of life expanding intelligence, love, power & joy in harmony with Spirit. Having recognized the error of time & space being the essence of life, a close relationship develops with the Creator. Prayer in its essence really means \"Lord, please give me more of Yourself,\" a fact reflected in Holy Communion. Receiving the Divine Spirit is symbolized by bread & wine as representatives of energy-matter & life.Troward explains the role of cause and effect in The Divine Offering that assures mankind of God's love andrestorative power. Troward addresses several objections to the sacrifice of Christ, the Resurrection and the forgiveness of past sins. When time has no substantial existence, states of consciousness are all that remain; thus sins of the past have no existence (have been removed from the individual as far as the east is from the west). The Redeemer's sacrifice is the supreme manifestation of the interaction of law and personality. Redemption is the realization of the individual's eternal and perfect relation to the Father; it neutralizes fear, an emotion arising from unbelief in the love of God. Redemption as a manifestation of divine love, when properly understood, leaves no ground for fear.I find it interesting that the scholar Geza Vermes inThe Authentic Gospel of Jesuscame to the very same conclusion as Troward regarding the way Jesus\/Yeshua viewed the nature of God. With reference to, amongst others, the parable of the Prodigal Son, the portrait that emerges is that of a loving Father. There is no trace of severity or harshness in the God of Jesus who is a Father more than a King. With reference to the parable of the Prodigal Son, Troward highlights two great errors: (a) limiting the power of God by our own past experiences (b) thinking of Spirit as an impersonal \"cosmic force\" & thus believing that mankind must provide the intelligence for the creative process.Animus Dei (Spirit of God) is the principle of personality whilst Anima Mundi (soul of nature) is impersonal. Both infinite, they are complementary to one another. Anima Mundi or the soul of nature, revealed by the Law of Tendency in the material world, lacks the ability of individual selection. Being active, Divine Personality upholds nature as well as human personality. However, Anima Mundi is impressionable so both the Divine and human personalities influence nature.The power of the soul of man over the soul of nature is psychic. The author remarks that a sufficiently powerful concentration of will would produce dramatic effects through the Anima Mundi which might explain scriptural statements regarding the signs & wonders to be performed by three main figures at the conclusion of the present age. Troward warns the reader about philosophies that deny the personality of God; the logical result is to elevate the self to the status of deity, which is a form of idolatry that promotesmalignant narcissism.The book concludes with Trowards observations on the sound philosophy, reason & science in theGood Book, how these confirm the law of cause & effect and ultimately direct mankind to a new consciousness when God's perfect laws will live within our hearts & minds as promised in Jeremiah 31 and various other passages.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Simply staten this is one of the finest books ever written in applied electromagnetics.There is a deligthful analytical treatment of everything related to wave-propagation in waveguides.But Mr Collin is not a dry-hearted teacher ,he is able to explain very complicated mathematical instruments with a very clear and fresh approach.Expecially good is the Green Function's treatment which is the best i ever saw in any book.Reading this book you will be able to progress from the intermediate to the very advanced level in Applied Electromagnetism.While it is true that nowadays there is a lot of software around that analyses almost every conceivable structure,it is also true that a analytical study gives you the possibility to sort the important from the accessory ,a thing no computer system is still able to do.I reccomend this book to anyone interested in advanced Electromagnetism.Only bad point is the price ,which is too much high expecially with the weak Euro we have now .On the whole a &quot;top&quot; book:5 stars!","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Set in early nineteenth century England, Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens is the tale of a poor orphans struggle to free himself from the clutch of criminals in London's dark underworld.

He finds the hot-tempered horse, which he names Gabilan, a challenge and carefully follows the management instruction of Billy Buck, his father's ranch assistant. Unfortunately, the pony catches severe cold aften it was drenched in a downpour.In spite of Billy Buck's expertise on horses, Gabilan dies. The second part- &quot;The Great Mountains&quot;- relates Jody's encounter with Gitano an old man from the mountains. The man has come back to live and die in the ranch since he was born there but Jody's father is not interested in making any deal with him. Gitano later disappears to the mountains with Old Easter, an old horse. In the third part-&quot;The Promise&quot;- Jody's father hatches a plan to replace the deceased pony, and Jody is actively involved in the process. He takes Nelly, one of their mares to a nearby ranch for mating with a stallion. She becomes pregnant later and Jody waits impatiently for her to throw the colt. Again, hard luck follows him as the horse develops complications.Billy Buck rips her open and extracts the colt. We are not told the fate of Nelly. In part four - &quot;The Leader of the People&quot; - we learn about the sour relationship between Jody's father and grandfather. The old man is despised because he tells endless stories about horses and 'westering'. During an unwelcome visit to the ranch, it dawns on the old man that the time has come for a change. He gradually shifts the theme from horses to &quot;There's no place to go&quot; and tries to plant it in Jody's head as the boy clings to him.This book is not only instructive but entertaining, although parts 2 and 3 do not seem to fit in precisely.One has to look beyond the letters to identify the underlying message.

The fact that it is an autobiographical tale (Conrad was a seaman for twenty years) adds great excitement to the telling. I always wanted to pick the book up again, so, last week, I did and was very glad I did. The reading of that event was as gripping as the first time around. Further, I was more able to appreciate the other qualities of Conrad's writing this time round. I will, however, state at the beginning of this review that, for many modern readers, his late nineteenth century style of prose will probably be far too wordy for them. One example of this will suffice to show what I mean. Here it is. `The feverish and shrill babble of Eastern language struggled against the masterful tones of tipsy seamen, who argued against brazen claims and dishonest hopes by profane shouts'. And that's just on the first page! On the other hand, such wordiness, for a patient modern reader, gives, in my humble opinion, great rewards because he will find himself sucked into the world of isolation, desperation, courage, stoicism, and sheer terror that was life on a sailing ship.For me, the portrayal of the gale that had the two and a half dozen men strapped to the ship as it lolled in tremendous waves for twenty-four hours ON ITS SIDE (how scary is that?), is the highlight of the novel. For Conrad, though, I think he meant it to be the tale of a black seaman who came on board, feigned illness to get out of his duties, and then slowly but surely realized that he really was very sick and was facing his imminent death. This character and his dilemma had a profound effect on his shipmates and the novel examines that in detail. Conrad's characterization is masterful and, by book's end, the reader feels he knows the men very well; from cowardly, trouble-making Donkin to the oldest sailor, Singleton, who stood with his knees locked into the wheel for thirty hours as he fought to keep the ship from turning completely over and drowning everyone on board. And any review of this book that omits the fact that Conrad was Polish is remiss because it is astounding to realize that the writer of this wonderful tale is not a native English speaker. He obviously had a brilliant ear for linguistics. Read this example of Donkin's speech, Donkin being an Englishman of the lowest class.`....Will yer? Are yer a bloomin' kid? ....Tell an' be damned! Tell, if yer can! I've been treated worser'n a dog by your bloomin' back-lickers. They `as set on me, only to turn against me. Who axed me ter `ave a drink of water?' and so the revolting man goes on.So, despite the unfashionable wordiness of this work (and the oh, so politically incorrect usage of the term in the title), I am filled with admiration for this writer. Will I return to this novel again? You bet I will.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I started out looking for ways to improve my memory and overcome some of my thoughts of fear of failure. I've listened to people in person explain to me the part of setting goals to succeed in life. These goals that I had set for myself were never achieved, and I had set it in my mind that I was not to be of those people who succeed and have great abundance of all things in their lives. This book explained how I had set myself up for failure just by thinking about failure is going to happen. I had to sit back and reflect on my past activities and thoughts. I remembered the many times I said \"I can't ....\", \"I have no money...\". I have fifty four years of bad habits to overcome, I thought to myself. It really put a crimp in the works. I had to do some plumbing in my house, you know cut and solder all the piping. I was thinking of getting a plumber, but I thought I can't afford it. I was afraid of doing it myself in case of 'screwing it all up'. I was really feeling depressed about this, thinking about how am I going to get this plumbing work done. I read the book a second time, only this time I did the exercises. It was hard at first, my attention span wandered. But by being consistent and just thinking in my mind the picture of me cutting and soldering all the copper pipe I had it in my mind that I was confident of doing this with no problems. I already had all the supplies bought, so after 2 weeks of plumbing pictures flowing through my mind, one morning after getting up I just went ahead and did the plumbing, without thinking of what would happen, or wondering if their would be leaks. I just had it in my mind that eveything would be ok. I had no fear. After it was all done, and I turned the water main back on----everything was ok. The thoughts of fear seem to disconnect a person from the abundance of life around them.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"\"Joanna\" is Book Three in Roberta Gellis' marvelous \"Roselynde Chronicles.\" As with all the individual novels that make up the series, this one stands alone, on its own merit. The novels actually do chronicle history, with meticulous accuracy, so it is helpful to read the books in sequence to understand the politics and reigns of each king. The characters are so richly drawn, even the minor ones, that it is an added touch to watch them grow and mature with every new book.The story opens during the reign of King John. The treacherous, cruel King has taxed his people heavily; there is political intrigue and moral laxity at court; international problems with the French, Welsh, and Irish bode ill for England's security; and the barons are unhappy with their monarch. The Church is unhappy with John also. He has tried to take control of the Church through his choice for the archbishop of Canterbury, and has been seizing Church revenues for the Crown. The Pope has excommunicated him.Joanna, Alinor of Roselynde's teenage daughter, has consented to a betrothal with Sir Geoffrey Fitzwilliam, her stepfather's squire of old, who is now a landed knight and budding warrior. He is also the illegitimate son of the King's half brother, and so has royal Plantagenet blood. Alinor and her husband Ian, leave for Ireland to assist the Earl of Pembroke in keeping the peace. They place 20 year old Geoffrey in charge of their vassals in case of war with the Welsh, knowing that Geoffrey's father will back him up if necessary. Joanna is to take charge of their land holdings. Like her mother, Joanna is literate, independent, and trained to care for her people and land, making difficult decisions when needed. Her temperament is less volatile than her mothers and she keeps her feeling to herself. Although she is pleased with her betrothed, who she has known since childhood, she is afraid to love. She has seen war, suffering and loss, including the death of her beloved father some years before. Joanna is a courageous young woman, but fears to lose her heart to Geoffrey, and hopes for a steady, companionable relationship, no more.As Joanna's and Geoffrey's relationship changes, so does the political climate in England. There are more storms than fair days here, however. A hard war begins with Wales. The Pope absolves all men from their fealty to King John. Philip of France now holds Normandy, which belongs to John. And the King, and Isabella, his Queen, conspire against Geoffrey and Joanna.Ms. Gellis takes us on an incredible journey through the King's court, medieval keeps, sieges and battles for life, land and honor, the horrific fire that devastated London in 1212, the signing of the Magna Carta by King John at Runnymede and his repudiation of the charter later. Civil War tears the country apart and King Philip invades England with mercenaries. This is exciting stuff!Joanna and Geoffrey love, marry and are separated by the many events that impact the country. Joanna, at one point must travel, during the war with the French, to rescue her husband who is near death.I liked this book very much, to say the least. However, it does not merit the five stars I gave the first two books in the series. Because of the turmoil of John's reign, the many problems are reflected in the relationship between the two main characters. While this is realistic, it was difficult to read about depressing times and depressed people. But, hey! Four stars is very good!JANA","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Almost forty years ago I read this beautiful book, I was fourteen.

Ophiel was a very straight forward writer on these subjects. He really knew what he was writing about. His instructions are clear, simple, right to the point, free of all the fluff so often found in books nowadays days, and very effective. His writing style is also very amusing - very American colloquial, casual and unpretentious. It is hoped that Weiser will eventually reprint all of Ophiel's books.

This one, like the previous six, features wonderful writing, a further sensitive and perceptive development of the relationship and personalities of Duncan Kincaid and Gemma James, and interesting, well-drawn characters and suspects.However, the plot is not up Crombie's usual standards. The mystery begins with some sort of supernatural communication from a long-dead monk to a modern-day architect, Jack Montfort, who happens to be Kincaid's cousin. This communication, in the form of some sort of involuntary writing in Medieval Latin which comes to Montfort while in a trance, provides the continuing thread for the entire plot.Crombie (and all of her characters) apparently take this notion seriously. No rational explanation is given for this phenomenon, nor for the mysterious power of the nearby \"Glastonbury Tor\" - a forbidding, bleak, low mountain that dominates the landscape. There are vague echoes of \"Rosemary's Baby\" in the story. But that movie never resorted to out-of-body experiences to explain the plot - everything that happened was the result of pure human evil, which is a lot easier to believe in.For me, the New Age irrationality and unreality detracted mightily from the pleasure of reading Crombie's superb writing and character development. I hope this book was just an aberration.","sentiment_score":0.6},{"review":"Unfortunately, one star is the least you can give in a review. To anyone who is considering picking this book up: DON'T. To those of you who were caught up by the three (at least) outstanding books that began the series, I share in your misery. I read the first 6 books in about two weeks from start to finish. Including going to the bookstore repeatedly to pick up the next volume. This book has taken me OVER TWO MONTHS to get through. Absolutely dreadful. NOTHING HAPPENS in the book. My prayer is that RJ will read the now-over-1000 comments on this book which almost uniformly lament the crushing nosedive the series has taken. You have been swindled! Obviously, noone would pick up the eighth book in a series without reading the earlier volumes. The early books are the BAIT and this is the SWITCH. I don't want to resort to the long-winded drivel that RJ has such a keen hand for, in sum- THIS BOOK SUCKS!

I even bought some for my grandparents to fill out for me.After searching through everything Amazon has to offer, I ended up purchasing a variety of books. I bought Mom, Dad, Grandma and Grandpa, Tell Me Your Memories. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I really didn't think they would all be the same with a different cover page as they are. I was really disappointed in the size of the books. They are 4\" x 5.5\" with a 1\" spiral binding. Each is about 1\" thick. It is laid out for a full calendar year - each day having a different question or memory for the person do write about. The pages have a question at the top and are blank (no lines) below.The other books I decided to purchase are: A Grandparent's Legacy and Memories for My Grandchild. A Grandparent's Legacy is laid out month-by-month with topics to discuss. The book measures 8\" x 5\" with a nice covered spiral binding and is about .75\" thick. Each page has topics to discuss and lines for writing. Memories for My Grandchild has the most flexible layout - meaning there is no guide for filling things out at a certain time. It is also the largest book, measuring about 8\" x 10\" and just less than 1\" thick. It has a covered spiral binding. This is the only book with a pocket in the back to drop in any special items and a pull-out page to fill in the family tree. The pages in this book are lined as well.The books all cover similar questions and memories. I haven't gone page-by-page to compare, but have been pleased with what I've seen so far. Since the books are so similar, I'm basing my overall opinion on the appearance. My favorite would have to be A Grandparent's Legacy.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I had to read this book in high school, and I didn't love or hate it.

This has resulted in many confusions about what Stanislavski actually said.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Loaded with imagery. The wickedness of Captain Wolf Larsen and the affection between Humphrey Van Weyden and Maud Brewster seems exaggerated but the author is using these things for higher purposes.Also, it's hard to believe that there could be another Wolf Larsen-type character in existence (the other being Wolf's brother, Death Larsen, captain of the ship Macedonia) but Jack London wants us to realize that animalism and death exist, are related, and ever present. Only love (the kind Hump and Maud develop) and work offer respite from this gloomy reality.London adds emphasis through his choice of name for the ship -- The Ghost (the boat piloted by Wolf Larsen, signifying how body and animalism dominate the soul during earthly life). Traveling through the soul (or \"ghost\"\/spirit) is the best way to combat life's travails that spring up like sudden storms upon the sea.\"The Sea Wolf\" succeeds in a way that most great works of literature do -- a popular story that can be enjoyed by the masses but also containing deep parables for elevated hearts and minds. London's story falls into the great convoy of ocean adventures that include the biblical book of Jonah (check out the Vilna Gaon's superb commentary on Jonah -- Aderes Eliyahu) and Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick\" that teach timeless lessons.Wolf Larsen proves the truth of F.A. Hayek's theory that the strict rationalist tends to become a barbarian. I found my pro-life convictions challenged by Wolf's superficially appealing utilitarian explanation of why people guard their lives. It's true but not the whole story. I dove deeper into pro-life principles to refute Larsen's materialism uber alles. To wit, why would life (human adults) fight to preserve other life (unborn children) that, in most cases, it doesn't even know. Wouldn't adult life be afraid of what incoming life could potentially take away? The answer there is yes and that helps sustain the pro-abortion impulse. But the fact that there are adults willing, at cost to themselves, to seek protection for lives of coming generations that they have no acquaintance with suggests to the reasonable mind that the soul exists and is at work in such rescuers.This phenomenon doesn't exist in the animal world (animals only fight for their own kind). It shows that the soul makes humans qualitatively different from the rest of existence.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Sasse is important not only because he is a famous Lutheran theologian who was around during Nazi Germany. More important, as this book demonstrates, the residual influence this man had upon his students and their students with the adapt theology of this great Christian.Sasse was such an astute man of the history of the Christian church, and at the same time, an excellent exegete. His thought process is profound and succinct. Almost at times like the apostle John, appearing simple in sentence structure and vocabulary, yet profound when you begin to unpack each word with its depth and richness of meaning.In this volume are the speeches of the Sasse conference by his students, i.e. Nagel, Feuerhahan, Kleinig, Marquart, Hardt. Also, other contributors influenced by Sasse contribute to this volume.The contents are rich and vibrant with the substance of theology. Besides commentary of Sasse's life and writings, articles include: his relationship with the Third Reich, on worship, the confessing apostolic and catholic church, his reaction and interaction with Barth and natural theology, the mystery of sacred scripture, and his relationship with Rome.From Sasse's own words come this admonition to the church: &quot;When does the church exert its greatest influence in the world?

Perhaps it would even turn out to be a dream. A Christmas yarn starring Stephanie Plum and her crazy family and friends could be pretty darned hilarious.Stephanie's supporting cast are all here doing their crazy supporting cast thing, and there's even a progression (if you can call it that) on one front (is there anyone as stupid as Stephanie's formerly perfect sister?). This book would have been a short story if it hadn't been for Janet's army of characters, each (except Ranger) trotted out on cue.But they aren't enough to hold the book together. This is indeed a fantasy, but someone should have told both Janet and her editor that fantasies in particular need to be set in a world with certain rules. It must conform to its own interior logic, otherwise you lose the reader's suspension of disbelief. When you set up some kind of wishy-washy-not-sure-what's-going-on and get a character like Deisel who can do anything when it's needed, it becomes deus ex machina, one of the lowest tricks a writer can pull.My biggest disappointment was that once again, Stephanie doesn't live up to her role as hero and complete the case. Janet, please stop falling in love with your male romantic leads and let Stephanie once again be the star! By now she should also have progressed in her abilities. She should not still be starving (yet able to bribe people? and buy loads of presents?) and clueless.","sentiment_score":0.4},{"review":"It is hard to find any information on Tendai in English, this is a good book as a reference and a valuable tool.

I would like to see a second book with the tendai teachings and practices more detailed.

Not only are the old characters (Tas, Goldmoon) written better in this book (In Fallen Sun, they seemed strangely unlikeable) the new characters, like Mina and Silvanoshei become more fleshed out and appealing (though not Gilthas. I fear poor Gilthas is doomed to remain a static character for the rest of eternity).Without giving away any spoilers (when people give away spoilers in Amazon.com reviews it just irritates me like all hell) I thought the scenes with Mina, her followers, and the One-God were done much better than in the first book. In the first book, the only event that provided any dynamic was her meeting with Mirror. In this book, the reader sees more than simpy &quot;Ah Mina! I worship you and the One-God!&quot; To cut it short, it's less religious-fanaticism-by-the-numbers than the first book.We get to see more about Tasslehoff and Goldmoon, and Goldmoon's big secret and mystery, which I was expecting to be a letdown, was rather interesting, if not entirely original.But for those of you who seek action, the wars with the elves are good... but not Hickman-Weis great in my opinion. Beryl and Qualinost does not measure up to, say, The Attack on Neraka in Spring Dawning, or the High Clerist Tower's Final Stand in Summer Flame. But it does nicely change the pace of the book from early on. The real strength of this book lies with Mina, Tasslehoff, Goldmoon, Silvanoshei... and a few others who I may not name.If you're still doubting whether you should read this book, I have one more thing to remind you of:What about Dalamar?","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"For years I had known people who read Ms. Rand's books and raved about them. Now I understand. But take heed: her other major work (Atlas Shrugged) is not a good introduction to Rand; the Fountainhead is the proper starting point. It certainly deserves to be included among any top ten list of American classics. A belief system that values the creative power of the individual, strength of character, uncompromising principles, and other admirable qualities are told in a compelling manner. You must view the world (and your role in it) a bit differently after reading this book. Now, why the heck isn't the Gary Cooper movie version out on DVD? Strangely, the book seems to explain that too.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the greatest novels in English literature and is truly deserving of being called a classic. First published in 1813, it is set at the turn of the 19th century in a fictional town near London. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are blessed with five daughters, ranging in age from 15 to 22. The novel opens with Mrs. Bennet anxiously thinking about how to marry her daughters off, as that was the primary way for women to achieve financial security during those times. The story is told in third person from the point of view of the second eldest daughter Elizabeth Bennet.Of the four Jane Austen novels that I've read, Pride and Prejudice is my favorite. This is not because I didn't enjoy the others, I most certainly did, but rather because Pride and Prejudice affected me on so many different levels. It touched my heart and swept me away, as I absolutely fell in love with Mr. Darcy. It also provoked my mind, as I reflected upon the many issues that Austen explores in this novel. It is a subtle book, as all Jane Austen novels are, and that is its beauty. All of the issues that Jane Austen raises in this book slowly simmer in your mind.One of the reasons I love Pride and Prejudice is that it is a romance for those with a bit of a feminist streak. Elizabeth Bennet is a strong character who isn't afraid to speak her mind. She is no weak wallflower. Many romantic plots feature a damsel in distress who is saved by her knight in shining armor. That is most definitely not the case here. The love story in Pride and Prejudice shows that you can have chivalrous man and grand romantic gestures without a weak heroine.I also love Pride and Prejudice for Austen's excellent treatment of the characters. Both of the main characters, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, grow, develop, and change throughout the novel. Their character developments are deep, thorough, and convincing. In contrast, the supporting characters do not change much. Their constancy provides a nice point of comparison to the growth of the main characters.The novel is a full-fledged social commentary on marriage, love, money, wealth, social class, propriety, as well as pride and prejudice. It is fascinating to learn how different those times were from today, especially in the lack of opportunity for women; and yet, it is even more fascinating to think about how relevant the issues are to today. The more things change, the more they seem to stay the same.If you only read one Jane Austen novel, let it be Pride and Prejudice. Be patient with the old English language. It is not an easy read, but it is worth your while.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Build your Fluid Mechanics Muscles and Get Better Grade with this Book!!I am one of the students who are hungry for various solved problems collected and written by experts in any subject of my interest. This book is really a very powerful tool in your hand. I used this book when I took Engineering Fluid Mechanics course (ME 311) in my university KFUPM, Saudi Arabia. I am sure as God made a little green apple that the students will find this book beneficial from several sides.Speaking for myself, it helped me in solving some of my homework problems. Sometimes, you do not find the vary problem you are looking for, but you will find a problem that shares the same concept that your homework problem does. That is, regardless of the book you are using for this course, this very powerful book will be fine.Secondly, I found that some of the questions given in this book are exactly same as the questions given in my major exams or sometime they share the same concepts. This, certainly, will guarantee that you will collect a large amount of scores out of your total score. Needless to say, you will get an excellent grade in this curse, Lord willing. However, this all depends on you.I think that you should not solve a lot of problems given in this book if and only if you do not face any problems in understanding the major and minor concepts in this course as this book has repeated solved problems sharing the same concepts. Indeed, this book has got thousands of problems and if you spend a lot of time in solving them without paying attention to your other courses you will really be in deep water. You may get a good grade in this course; on the other hand, your grade in other courses will be too bad. Thus, I recommend you to concentrate on the questions that are new to you and on the ones that are similar (in concepts) to the ones that your instructor focuses on in the class and practice some of the Mice Mouse (=easy) problems and ignore their repeated paraphrased ones.On the Other hand, if you have difficulties in understanding the concepts of this course in your class, then do not worry at all because this wonderful book has a lot of problems with different level of difficulties, form the simplest idea in this course to the most difficult one. You will even find solved problems related to simplest equations formulas. More importantly, you may find problems having new concepts that are not provided by the textbook you are using for this course. Thus, all what you have to do is to burn the mid night oil (= keep practicing) and you will, hopefully, overcome any difficulties and get a good grade.Moreover, if you are aeronautical or aerospace engineer, you will appreciate this book very much in your aerodynamic courses as it has solved problems about dynamic drag and lift plus fundamentals fluid flow. So, you will hit two birds with one stone if you buy this book. Additionally, this book has several FORTRAN Programs that might be helpful in your terms projects.Unhappily, this book does not explain concepts, it just gives you solved problems. If the authors had explained the concepts of each chapter properly before solving the problems, then I would rate this book at 5 starts.To sum up, it is really worth to buy it and Good Luck.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"This book was so informative.

Turns out the book is nothing like that. It's a ground up introduction to Linux from the end-user perspective.

The last few chapters go into some depth on working in the shell and shell scripting, but it's pretty light.This is a solid introduction to end-user level Linux that should be suitable for anyone who is reasonably technical (no need to be a programmer). The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because of the reliance on numerous screenshots, which isn't the best way to explain things, and is not the quality that I expect from O'Reilly.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Wizards, warlocks, law gnomes, golems, trolls, magic, high-tech gizmos, and adventure all wrapped up into one intricate tale of enchantment that leaves the reader breathless and wishing for more--this is Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall, by JR King.Right away I was pulled in by the professional and artistic cover, the giant floating city looming in the background, three young wizards casting powerful spells, and when I opened the book, I was not in the least disappointed.Once you pick this book up, you can't put it down. Immmediately you are swept off into the vast wizarding universe and into the life of a young fourteen year old girl, Arianna Kelt.

It followed the path of Jihadi from disaffected youth to unstoppable monster. It showed how vague idealism and vanity can create a perfect storm from which otherwise normal and ambitious young men are transformed into vicious monsters that will kill women and children. I thought the complexity of this book extended further than expected, including portrayals of strong (but amoral) women as well as redeeming grace and nobility from otherwise corrupt aristocrats. The author is often ambivalent about the competing sects in Algerian society, even though it is plain that he does not withhold moral judgment from the terrorist\/protagonist. I think that the issue of our times is Islamic terorrism and Yasmina Khadra gets inside of the terrorist mind and the social-psychology of the Casbah in a way that is neither overly didactic, nor morally obtuse. I think this book exceeds \"In the Name of God\" both as a narrative and for showing how Islamists are a form of revolutionary at war with existing society, in spite of their pretensions of conserving Islam in pure form.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This story is a classic.

If you have seen one of the movies, then read the book as soon as possible, since neither of the movies do the book justice.The story starts out with young Bastian Balthasar Bux going into a bookstore and stealing a book entitled \"The Neverending Story.\" For reasons he can't explain, Bastian felt that he had to have the book. Shutting himself up in the school attic, he reads about Atreyu, the chosen messenger to find a cure for the Childlike Empress and prevent The Nothing from destroying Fantastica. Atreyu discovers that the Childlike Empress needs a new name, and that only someone from the human world, the savior, can give her one. The savior turns out to be none other than Bastian himself! He thinks of a new name for her once he reads about her, but he must say her name out loud for Fantastica to be saved. Fearing what the Childlike Empress will think of him once she sees him, Bastian holds off saying the name aloud. Eventually, when Fantastica's destruction is imminent, Bastian says her new name out loud, and he is drawn into Fantastica, and transformed into a handsome, heroic-looking figure. The Childlike Empress tells Bastian that whatever he wishes for will come true, until he finds out what he truly wants. Unfortunately, he soon finds out that for every wish, he loses a memory of his life in the human world. I will leave off at this point, except to point out that Bastian journeys in his wishes from self-centeredness to self-giving.\"The Neverending Story\" is a multi-layered work that people of all ages can enjoy. In addition to being a wonderfully readable fantasy\/adventure story, it is rich in philosophy and symbolism. For example, The Nothing that is slowly destroying Fantastica could be symbolic of people losing their capacity for imagination and creativity. In addition, Bastian's quest to find out what he really wants is immensely rich in its philosophical implications, not to mention Campbell-ite hero quest overtones.

We were only learning about the 1st decade of the 1900s when the AP exam came along! I ordered this book because it had good reviews, and I was desperate to get at least a 3, but with the help of this book, I got a 5!! The AP test is pretty tough, but this book does a good job because it gives you a summary of each important person, event, document, etc. without going into too much or too little detail. All of the other books I've used either inundated you with so much information that there was no possible way to read and memorize it all, or barely gave you any information. REA, however, gave the perfect sized summaries. It also has some very helpful practice tests, but you should be aware that they are not actual AP tests. I would recommend the Princeton Review's AP book if you want to take some authentic AP tests from years past, or if you want help with writing the essays or DBQ, but their summaries of U.S. History are vague and short. The only other problem I found with REA was that it did not cover enough of the civil and women's rights movements, which unfortunately happened to come up about 4 times on the AP test I took. However, this is only a minor detail because I still ended up getting a 5 even though I skipped those questions. Without ever taking an AP U.S. History class, I think you could get a 3 if you STUDIED from REA's book, but if you're in the class you can definitely get a 4 or a 5 if you STUDY hard.

She basically falls in love at first sight with the Duke of Lancaster, who is married to the lovely (and rich!) Blanche. She ends up married far beyond expectation to the knight Hugh Swynford. She bears him two children and then he dies. Almost immediately she and John begin an affair, even on the eve of his betrothal to the Infanta Constance of Castile. She ends up bearing him four children, causing a myriad of problems. Eventually her guilt and the scorn of her firstborn cause her to renounce John. However once his wife dies, he returns to her and proposes marriage, which ends with the legitimation of their children and happiness.Thoughts:-For whatever reason I kept picturing Richard Armitage as John of Gaunt despite the many references to his blond hair. I'm not sure why but I didn't really mind.-Geoffery Chaucer, author of The Canterbury Tales, was actually Katherine's brother-in-law. He married her older sister Pica and they mostly lived apart allowing him the opportunity to write.-Seton wrote some very vivid descriptions-in many ways it was like I was there (except that it didn't smell!)-A problem, for me, was the longstanding adulterous relationship of the couple. The way it is presented seems to make it okay because it's true love and it does eventually end in marriage but I was still somewhat uncomfortable.-I had some difficulties with the various titles, the fact that many people shared a name, the locations of places in England, Catholic practices, and some outdated words but they did not affect my ability to read the book.-His proposal is awful! He essentially says \"I've had other mistresses and other bastards but the only one I want to marry is you!\" [Wikipedia says he only had one other bastard] But what a terrible proposal-I don't think it would induce me to marry him. Of course it's not historically accurate because I really doubt either of them wrote down what was said so there's no way of knowing.-The beginning of the affair is fast. First John is mourning his first wife Blanche and then he's carrying Katherine to a bed where she refuses because she's still married. But once Hugh is dead, they're together. The falling in love is mostly overlooked-I would have preferred more but there are later scenes that are quite touching. In fact my favorite part was probably when they were together before the 1381 riots.Katherine is very strong. She is a loving mother, an outwardly devoted wife even when she is loathing Hugh and desiring John on the outside, a strong steward of the estate, and brave in the face of the riots.-I also liked the supporting female characters as in her sister Pica and her longtime devoted maid Hawise. I did not like her first daughter Blanche, whose meanness to her mother hurt me.Rating: 4\/5 It was good and I would definitely recommend it to people who like historical novels, romances, and\/or this time period.

L. Delderfield's novels in bookstores when I was a teenager in the 1960s, and was intrigued by their distinctive covers. But I never bought any of them at the time, and forgot about them over the decades -- until I stumbled across a bundle of them at a library book sale. This time I decided to give them a chance. And I've been richly rewarded!\"The Dreaming Suburb\" is the first half of \"The Avenue,\" which explores life in an English suburb between 1919 & 1947. This first volume follows the intertwining lives of several Avenue residents & their families, delving into their private dreams for the future, and the ways in which those dreams take totally unexpected turns. Delderfield offers us a wide range of personalities, and has the gift of making all their lives compelling, even when some of them make foolish or even amoral choices. We can always see why the characters are making those choices, and how logical those choices seem to them.The storytelling is solid, old-fashioned narrative, with a surprisingly small amount of dialogue, as opposed to so much contemporary fiction. The comparison to Dickens isn't overblown, either -- while the eccentric detail of Dickens may be missing, the pleasure of an intricate tale of everyday life, well-told & always fascinating, is definitely abundant. The overall tone is not unlike that of watching an exceptionally good BBC mini-series unfold, episode by episode, with plenty of room for humorous & poignant asides. There's a strong, heartfelt love for a people & a way of life that's long since passed, but still worth remembering.In short, it's what used to be called a Good Read.I'm surprised to see so few reviews of Delderfield's books here at Amazon, since their paperback editions sold what seems like millions of copies not so long ago ... but 3 or 4 decades is a long time, especially in this faster-paced world. That's a pity, since good storytelling should never be out of style. I'm glad to see that much of this work is finally being reprinted in trade paperback, although I'm still waiting for both volumes of \"The Avenue.\"Meanwhile, if you should come across any of these older paperbacks at a sale or used bookstore, do yourself a favor & give them a try. You may find, as I did, that once you start reading, you've got to keep turning the pages to see what happens next. From the disparate paths of the Carver family, to the romantic sorrows of young Esme Fraser, to the astonishingly dysfunctional Friths, to the somewhat lost sisters Edith & Becky, and so much more -- it's an entire world waiting to be discovered, highly recommended!","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I think that this book was a really great book for little kids, It tells how people can be scared of things that can happen. This book was a book that had a really nice lesson in it, and I think that it would most likley be a book that mothers, fathers, ect. can read together with their kids, and enjoy it at the same time. Madeline learned her lesson not to walk on the ledge of the bridge when she fell into the water and almost drowned. If it wasn't for the dog that saved her, she would of not lived! That is why I think that you should read this great book, and you will love it. This is an adventurous book, with lots of picture's and details. The dog who's name is Genevieve was a stray dog, and he was also the one who saved her. He soon after became her bestfriend. All the girls in the school all try to keep the dog from getting taken away from Madeline, even the nun that watched Madeline and the other girls sticked up for the dog. The inspectors came in and tried to take the dog away from the girls, and they were so upset. At the end, they got to keep the dog, and it was a very happy ending. When the author wrote this book, I think that he was thinking about the friendship that someone can have for an animal of any kind, or a person. This book shows alot of that. The kids will also love the surprise ending to the story, because I knoqw that I did. When I read the story, I could not put down the book, not even for one second. This was a great book, and I know that you will love it, and that is why you should get it.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This book is great!

Bottom line: buy this book!","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"When I first read &quot;Little Women&quot; I was twelve years old and now, several years later, it is still my favorite book. One of the reasons for that is that the book is effidently written with much love and feeling, which is quite understandable, knowing that it is based on Louisa Alcott's own life. It is really tragic when one finds out what Louisa's real life was like and the way she describes it in &quot;Little Women&quot;. It is as if she were decribing the life she wished for, while she tries at the same time to depict the truth. The way she describes the family life is heartwarming and I always hope that my children will love me as much as the March girls love their mother. The book is a picture of love, confidence and goodness. Some people may say it is too soft and moralistic, but I think that it can't do any harm to think about that once in a while. I mean, what is wrong with being good? The March girls are not saints, not even Beth, but they try to be as good as possible and many people should try that too. This book is most surely the loveliest story I have ever read and probably the best I'll ever read. And I don't think I am alone in that, otherwise it wouldn't be so popular today, over a hundred years after its first publication.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I am in my sixties and had never read Moby Dick. When I finished, my friend said, Did Gregory Peck really get swept away by the whale? Shows you how some people think they know what a book was about by the movies or what they had read in a review. I had no idea that Melville was so funny, so ironic and it makes me want to investigate what else he wrote. I loved the first-hand experience of what it was like to be in a fragile little boat racing with sail and oar to stab a whale upon a heaving sea! The technology of whaling was every bit as intriguing as the tale of the mad Captain Ahab pursuing his nemesis. Was fun to research what we know today about whales and compare it with Melville's accounts.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I have seen that the writings of E.

This story takes us back to the mid-19th century, from Chile to the gold rush town of San Francisco. I felt as if I were visiting these places while reading and as a teacher of history and a fan of a great story, I could not put the book down.

It had wierd and interesting creatures that were unique and not your average fairytale copycats. The story brings the characters to life with very descriptive words. It makes the reader feel as if he\/she is traveling and starving and tired and scared along with the rest of the characters.Gandalf, the wizard, is my favorite character. He always seems to know what's going on, even when he isn't around. He is smart and clever and can solve just about any problem with his magic or his wits. Sometimes he tricks people in a harmless and friendly way. He makes friends with a lot of the different characters you meet throughout the novel. He has many friends of all races (which is unusal for the story) such as dwarves, hobbits, elves and even special magic friends that can be more than one species of animalsThis is very interesting book. It is fun and exciting and paints wonderful adventures in my head. It is so good that I can't wait to begin Tolkien's other books.

The friendship between the two is unique because of the encouragement they give each other. The creation of Terabithia gives the two an outlet to be creative in, as well as allowing Jess to be king and Leslie to be queen.Adults enjoy this book due to the nostalgia that affects them, yet children enjoy this book because they are able to relate to the characters and their lives. As a teacher, I am amazed by the new perspective that I notice each time I read this book. What also amazes me is the students' reactions as they read Bridge to Terabithia.

Together they have many good and bad experiences, but all of them they will never forget. It is perfect for young adults, especially &quot;Little Women&quot; who are growing up, because of the experiences it deals with. With every turn of the page, there is a new adventure to be found. The book is so brilliantly put together that you won't even want to put it down. There are new situations and lessons to be learned after each chapter. The story relates it's situations to some that actually happen in everyday life. For example, the way Amy wants to look perfect all the time, and the way Jo acts like a tomboy. Through all the obstacles in the girls' lives, they always stick together working everything out, and never giving up. This story is a perfect example of how family's should love each other and not give up on anything.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"It says everything about this book, really, that the title comes from an intensely colloquial joke that is too obscene to repeat here. Frost on My Moustache is a travel humor book that focuses far more on humor and cursing than it does on the travel. But what it lacks in actual information it more than makes up for in laughter - the kind of oh-god-just-let-me-take-another-breath laughter that can lead to hospitalization, insanity, and inexplicable joy. However, Moore - and his book - aren't for everyone.Moore is very colloquially British - he uses lots of pop culture references that will not be obvious to most Americans (or Europeans or Australians or...). He's also very much like a certain kind of aging college student: perpetually intoxicated, foul-mouthed, inclined to rant and whine. But despite it all, he's lots of fun, and while you might not like him, you'll love reading about his travels.The word that most often gets used in Tim Moore book reviews is &quot;Bryson.&quot; The comparisons between Tim Moore and Bill Bryson are apparently unavoidable. And, to a certain extent, they hold true: both writers are very funny, both are extremely tightfisted, both spend an awful lot of time complaining. But Moore is not Bryson. At most, he could be described as an embryo Bryson - he hasn't yet learned the secrets of a wide appeal, a cultivated air, or a dignified approach to life. Moore curses, he wails, he throws regular temper tantrums, he's sulky and lazy and fixated. And he eats a lot of hot dogs. Don't expect thoughtful cultural exposition, insightful observations, or descriptions of the local cuisine from him.But I promise you: if you pick up Frost on My Moustache, you will experience frequent bouts of all-out hysteria. This book is well worth buying and reading, not once, but again and again.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Rees Howells Intercessor WILL change your life.

From the classic scene of Lookwood encountering Catherine Linton's ghost, I was hooked. Though the plot is not always fast-moving, it is strong and compelling. It is fun for readers to draw parallels between the two generations outlined in this novel. The atmosphere of the novel is one of mystery, set up early in the first few chapters. Though most of the characters are despicable in some way, hearing about their lives through Nelly's eyes is irresistible. The novel is littered with violence, and the \"moral\" of the story is unclear to the reader, as it possibly was to the author herself, yet it does make a few important points. Love is not everything, for example, is stressed from the moment that Catherine Earnshaw becomes a Linton. With vivid imagery and extremely psychological characters, Emily Bronte created a classic truly deserving of the title.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Ambrose shows his literary expertise as he chronicles the most famous exploring duo in American history. Using journals and other first person witness accounts, the reader is treated to a detailed description of Lewis and Clark's expedition to the pacific.

The reader should not be surprised, as the title emphasizes this point about the thesis.

I think he was written perfectly, notorious though admirable.This book is easily recommendable for young and old alike. There is no question on why it is a classic.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This is a deceptive book--at first glance it appears much shorter and more accessible that its putative motivator and predecessor, Charlotte Bronte's \"Jane Eyre.\" But the novel is fragmented, impressionistic, a pastiche of dreams and shifting viewpoints from inscrutable narrators. It's not at all an easy story to grab on to, yet it contains passages of undeniable evocative power, ranging from the Dionysian seductiveness of the tropics to the hysteria of a land in oppression and revolt.The reader who stays with the story--not once but two or three times--will be amply rewarded by an author capable of suggesting so much more than what appears on the surface. Rhys conveys the island culture, exposes its people and classes, but she also penetrates the psyche of a proud and brutal British colonist as well as the inner realm of fear and desire belonging to his prey: a woman and a culture in flux, both more wronged against than the other way around.The reader looking for a sequel to \"Jane Eyre\" is bound to be initially disappointed. Bronte establishes a style that, among its excellences, comes to represent an authoritative narrator and a decidedly confident Western point of view (albeit from a woman's angle of vision rather than a man's). By contrast, Rhys' style is so different as to strike the first-time reader as that of someone speaking, writing, and thinking in a language other than English--a language that the reader only gradually recognizes as his own.But that's much the novel's point--the strangeness and disorientation resulting from the invasion of a defenseless island by a stable, civilized, patriarchal society frustrated by its inability to assert its customary order and, above all, control. The Bertha Mason the reader meets in this story may be disappointing, unrecognizable, a construction as far removed from Bronte's and the reader's experience as a character from a completely different world. But that's who Bertha Mason is, the \"real\" Bertha Mason--and her difference should in no way exclude her from the reader's sympathy, curiosity, and desire to know more about her. Unlike the unnamed Rochester (who is certainly no less a stranger, especially to himself, than Bertha), the challenge for the reader (and all of us) is to learn from her and through her--the better to know ourselves.Though we may find the nightly television images from Haiti disturbing, we cannot afford to avert our eyes, to close our pocketbooks, to dissociate ourselves from the people of Haiti even as they die festering in the streets awaiting the bulldozers to plough them under. Bronte had some vague notion of the painful consequences of depriving others of their freedom, running heedlessly over their identities, and finally simply hiding them in some dark attic and throwing away the key. Paradoxical as it may seem, this latest catastrophe may be a first step toward unlocking the door. Contrary to Robertson, Limbaugh, and some of the other false prophets who purport to have access to higher wisdom, Haiti may not be God's punishment but our opportunity. The punishment could come should we fail to act to right a situation that next time could be much worse--and closer to our own shores.[Note: Despite Amazon's reference to the edition (above), this is the novel by Jean Rhys.]","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Everyone is comparing the english version of this manga with the japanese version. however; i bet most of the customers who decided to buy this book don't know any janasene at all, like me. so, instead of considering us \"unlucky to have these bad translations\", i think we are lucky cuz these manga books, especially the fourth one, are still enjoyable. the print is a little bit too dark, but still they are the best manga books i owned.i guess the japanese version is better, because it is the original one, but to all those who don't know japanese and still love sailor moon: buy this book and enjoy it instead of pittying that you don't know japanese!","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Hatchet by Gary PaulsenDo you like to read adventure\/action books?

I had to call up a friend, read the entire piece and just say, \"damn.\" If poetic skill could be equated to narcotic potency, Willie Perdomo's Smoking Lovely would be an illegal substance. He is phenomenal poet, the epitome of Nuyorican poetry, blending Spanish and English metaphors seamlessly, with a singularity and power that is halting. Often in the world of Spoken Word poetry, what sounds good does not translate with equal prowess to paper. Willie Perdomo is master of both page and stage, evidencing the beauty and majesty that is born when great writing weds great performance.His metaphoric world reflects images of violence and humor, love and stink, drug abuse, prison and overcoming. Everything that is New York City sweet and sour is delivered with honesty. A CD that accompanies the book, read by the author, is an added bonus, offering an even more intimate view into the Perdomo poetic window. There are no music tracks to camouflage or hide behind. None are needed, as his verse alone seizes ears. In one poem he writes, \"...there's a disco ball spinning starlight on the New Boogaloo.\" I write, the spinning starlight is Willie Perdomo's talent, and the New Boogaloo is Smoking Lovely.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"If you are following the VB route towards the MCAD\/MCSD .NET certification, you can't do better than with this book!

While a good understanding of ADO.NET goes pretty deep, doing these excercises made me feel like I had at least touched upon many of the things that can be done with ADO.NET.

They are not hesitant to give their versions. The author has not taken sides, nor tried to interpret, the sometimes destructive relationships that were defined by casual sex, drug addiction, alcoholism, and money. Instead she lets the band tell the story. The reader is left to his own conclusions. In my opinion, these are talented, but not very nice people. This is a fan's book, and there is much to enjoy about the band's story. The author has obviously talked to many people, and the story is very interesting. The message I get from the book is that Rock and Roll, for all it's glamour, is a tough business, for tough people. Skynyrd has suceeded while most have failed. These guys have a lot to offer. Read this book, and you will understand them much better.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This is a fantastic book that helps you figure out how to eat well balanced meals. It is something that you can do for the rest of your life and do it rather simply. Not only that, it is personalized for you. It tells you what you should eat of the foods they recommend according to your weight, and activity level, very helpful. Most diet books only tell you what you should eat, and you can be eating WAY too much of it. It is easy to read, easy to follow, and has some delicious recipes that I was amazed by, and that my family all really liked. I enjoy eating the way the Formula says, it makes sense, helps me feel better, and is helping me lose more weight after I had plateued. THIS IS NOT a PROTEIN DIET book, you only get well balanced meal ideas and recipes. The price tag... is a bargain in my opinion.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"The book I read was called Banner in the Sky.

My family book club read Sister Carrie immediately after finishing a book about another Carrie -- Carol Kennicott of Main Street. What a great pair of books to read together.I found Sister Carrie to be even more readable than Main Street. To me, this book read much like a soap opera. The girl who \"works\" her way from rags to riches, the tormented (or tormenting?) men she leaves behind.This is a GREAT book for discussion, because we found that what we thought about these characters changed with each chapter. We also spent some time trying to figure out what the chapter titles. The \"tinder box\" theme was especially delicious.Sister Carrie was the type of book that you have a hard time putting down. What will happen next? Our group predicted and changed our minds a hundred times.I think this novel about a young woman's venture from country life into the city and all of the people she affects is definitely one most anyone would enjoy. I especially recommend reading it in comparison to Main Street, in which the opposite happens - a girl moves from Minneapolis to rural Minnesota.Also like Main Street, Dreiser uses personal experiences in Sister Carrie. In fact, the introduction by Richard Lingeman in the Signet edition was especially interesting to me. I recommend reading it after you've read Sister Carrie. Enjoy!","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I am a voracious and selective reader and recently decided to read this book as a departure from the contemporary novels I generally read.

Steinbeck is hard to beat, in any era!","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, Kanigel does not dwell much on Ramanujan's mathematics. However, this is a spectacularly outstanding biography (this is not an exaggeration, believe me). Anyone who reads this book cover to cover will 'know' Ramanujan as well as they know their best friend. The many sides of this prodigy's personality - his affinity for mysticism, his need for public approbation, his gentle good nature - are all expertly transmitted. The tragedy of a life cut short at the height of its productivity will be felt keenly even by the 'toughest' of readers. Kanigel deserves high praise indeed for the masterly way he evokes time and place: Southern India and Cambridge (England) during 1900-20. If it were possible to award 6 stars, I would have done that.A few further points: 1) Kanigel's decision to give G. H. Hardy equal importance (almost) as Ramanujan is a strength of this book, not a drawback. This decision adds much richness to the narrative. 2) Kanigel returns to one question repeatedly: What is 'genius' and where does it come from? He succeeds in getting the reader to wonder along with him. There is probably no (one) good answer, but a life such as Ramanujan's should lead one to ponder this deeply. 3) I wish that in a future edition Kanigel would include an appendix, with some of the more accessible of Ramanujan's mathematical formulae. I am sure that any one of the 'gang of three' Ramanujan specialists (George Andrews, Richard Askey, and Bruce Berndt) would help him with this if he requested. The biography is superb, as already stated, but this would be dessert for those readers who have a mathematical background.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I recently saw Tim Sanders speak at a private business forum. His message range loud and clear: people do business with people they like. As a business coach, I talk to business owners and professionals all the time, and I can tell you that in my experience, many people in business are so transaction-oriented that they fail to do the simple things that create the kind of warm personal interaction that people need to feel good about doing business with someone. It's the likeability stuff that sticks with people and leads to repeat business and referrals. Tim Sanders' book is not only a reminder that we need to pay more attention to how we interact with people, he shows us how to become more likeable. It may seem like a simple concept, but it's essential. Highly recommended reading for anyone whose business depends on influencing others!","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"After all, how seriously can you take a book in which Rosemary's baby turns out to have horn buds, claws and the eyes of an owl (or something like that)? Obviously, this little baby isn't ever going to gain too much power unless he takes a file to his skull protrusions, wears gloves constantly and contacts. Unless he became a freaky rock star. I haven't read &quot;Son of Rosemary&quot;. . .wonder if that's how he turned out? Anyhow: this book is a black comedy that provides several chills along the way. Guy, Rosemary's husband, is such a duplicitous jerk (a character type that Levin used again in 'The Stepford Wives') but Rosemary has no inkling as to what he has done to further his career. Her neighbors seem to be such friendly, caring old folks. Her obstetrician delivers all the 'society babies'. Only one person suspects that things aren't what they're cracked up to be, but he makes an unfortunate exit midway through the novel. This book is good, but not as well-done as the movie, with its creepy soundtrack, wonderful direction and terrific actors. FYI: the movie is incredibly similar to the book, down to the decor of the apartments and pages of dialogue. The reason for that is that Roman Polanski, the director, had no idea that he could take liberties with the novel and thought he was legally obligated to stay true to the author's intentions. Would that more movie directors working today thought the same!","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"The author writes two stories in one.

The authors seem impatient to get on with the action-- and to finish the manuscript, so that they can begin the next title in the series. This novel, Tey's best, is a cut above such standard fare. It offers enough suspense (and a hugely understated love story) to keep the pages turning, while being as thoroughly worked out as mainstream literature. The Franchise Affair and The Great Gatsby are the only novels I've read repeatedly, and I revisit them because they create their worlds so economically and effectively. You might also enjoy the British movie by the same name, starring Michael Denison and his wife, Dulcie Grey.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"If you loved the old &quot;National Lampoon,&quot; but felt it never got quite nasty enough, then &quot;The Onion&quot; is for you. Its parodies of news stories and newspaper columns are always good for a laugh, but sometimes can get savage in the style of Jonathan Swift in his &quot;Modest Proposal&quot; period. Good cases in point are JonBenet Ramsey's letter from Heaven and the op-ed piece, &quot;It's Not a Crack House, It's a Crack Home.&quot; But if those are not to your taste, you can always read about Bill Gates patenting ones and zeroes, or researchers' conclusion that babies are &quot;incredibly stupid,&quot; or inimitable advice columns such as &quot;Ask a Faulknerian Idiot Man-Child.&quot; I take personal umbrage that a few favorites of mine from theonion.com didn't make it into this book, such as Jesse Helms and Tristan Tzara joining to fight the National Endowment for the Arts, or Wal-Mart opening a store in Winesburg, Ohio.

The Input Hypothesis attempts to account for the processes in which languages are learned. According to Krashen, the only way in which learners can acquire language is through comprehensible input which is slightly above the learners level. One surprising point he makes is that formal learning never leads to acqusition. The primary method of getting comprehensible input is through listening or reading. In other words, it is not so important for learners to practice speaking to acquire language.While some of Krashen's claims are interesting, in the end his hypothesis doesn't hold water. Several of his terms aren't well defined and his theories prove impossible to experiment with. The studies which he claims support his hypothesis either don't really support it or only support it indirectly. A final complaint is that some of the assumptions he makes rests on faulty concepts. For example, he misapplies the concept of Chomsky's Language Acquisition Device (LAD).In the end, the input hypothesis proves to be less than promised. However, students of applied linguistics may find this book interesting as it illuminates some of the assumptions that we take for granted. In bringing these assumptions into question, this book provides something of benefit to the student of applied linguistics.","sentiment_score":0.6},{"review":"If you have ever been curious to know what is the mathematics behind the fancy formulas describing the average-case behavior of algorithms -- this book is for you. An excellent addition to the classic &quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot; by D.Knuth, &quot;Introduction to Analysis of Algorithms&quot; by R.Sedgewick and P.Flajolet, and &quot;Analysis of Algorithms&quot; by M.Hofri, this book walks reader through a beautiful, and at the same time very diverse (not to say complex) world of mathematical tools and techniques needed to obtain precise answers to questions like &quot;what is the average depth of a digital tree built over $n$ strings?&quot;, or &quot;what is the average number of comparisons performed by a Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm when it searches for a given pattern of length $m$ in a random text of length $n$?&quot;.Being well organized, the book present these (sometimes very sophisticated) techniques in a simple step-by-step fashion, starting with brief reviews of several known (and necessary for future presentation) results from probability, complex analysis\/special functions, and information theory. The presentation of the numerous specific techniques is split in two parts: explaining probabilistic and analytic approaches to the analysis of algorithms correspondingly. Probabilistic techniques (inequalities of moments, limit theorems, large deviations, etc.) are very useful in the analysis of complex random structures, as they often yield simple estimates of their asymptotic behavior, where more accurate techniques fail or become prohibitively laborious. Analytic techniques (generating functions, singularity analysis, saddle point techniques, Mellin transform, analytic poissonization and depoissonization) on the other hand, represent a toolbox for exact modelling of the characteristics of the algorithms, yielding estimates of unparalleled precision.As indicated by its title, this book is mostly devoted to the analysis of a special class of combinatorial algorithms - ones that operate with sequences of symbols, or sequences. For example, it includes a detailed analysis of various algorithms for searching and sorting alphanumeric sequences based on digital trees (tries, digital search tries, Patricia-tries, etc.), redundancy expressions for popular Lempel-Ziv data compression schemes, average complexity estimates for text pattern-matching algorithms (such as Knuth-Morris-Pratt scheme), and so on.Following the tradition of &quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot;, the author wraps many results in the form of exercises, so that active readers can have fun solving them. These excersises are grouped into several classes, ranging from simple routine calculations to serious research problems (including ones that are currently unsolved).Overall, this is a very good graduate-level textbook and a valuable (and almost self-contained) source of information for everyone interested in the analysis of algorithms.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This is a book that addresses the subject of who Jesus was. Period. It's not a discipleship book or doctrinal review. The author has written other more indepth books on this subject, and in More Than A Carpenter he attempts to present this in a brief, easy to read book. His primary audience seems to be students, both Christian students, persons contemplating Christianity and even skeptics.In my opinion, the book accomplishes what it set out to do. Josh McDowell has been involved in ministry to students for decades and has learned to communicate on their level in a manner that they can easily understand. This book deserves its place as a Christian classic.But I do not wish to limit my recommendation of this book to young people only.

Never mind that the reader is being asked to psychically contact an unseen paradise called &quot;Fairyland City&quot;. It may sound ridiculous, but don't put the book down until you've done some of the exercises. Do them with the faith and knowledge that they'll work. They've worked for quite a number of people. This volume transcends the usual self-help fodder and glides, albeit gently, into the realm of magick. It comes off like a blend between gentle white magick and new age pop psychology, but it's useful. Skeptics will be forced to engage a &quot;willing suspension of disbelief&quot; here. If you're lacking in imagination, forget it. This book is all about imagination; moreover, it's about actively using that imagination toward the goal of self-liberation. Rather than just reading a compendium of dry pages, the reader is asked to actively pursue one psychic exercise after another. These exercises, strange as they may seem at moments, can be highly effective. There are exercises for luck, self-esteem, purification, forgiveness, prosperity and more. This book has helped a lot of people. It may or may not prove helpful to you, but if you possess enough faith and imagination to put these brief exercises into action, you may just find yourself with an improved outlook on life.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"I enjoyed both the content and the manner in which it was constructed.

For the skeptic, consider yourself remiss to overlook this book and for the Non-believer, this work will renovate your thinking. Edersheim has put together a true masterpiece herein. His depth of research on the subject matter is totally comprehensive. A commitment of 7 years, in almost complete solitude, was made to the writing of this book by he and his daughter.Literally thousands of footnotes, drawn from nearly every major Jewish writing of the time, are listed on the pages of this book indicating the intense discipline and scholarly effort enforced by the writer. An impression of truth and trustworthiness almost overwhelms readers as they have literally noted in conversation with me as I have passed this book along to many friends and acquaintances.This book is a bon-a-fide \"best effort\" to set before it's readers the daily foot steps of Jesus of Nazareth so that His words and works may bring us to an understanding of Jesus The Messiah that will blaze with a brightness that will light every other understanding.Finally, to put oneself to the task of completing this book is an undertaking.

The story is told through the eyes of Professor Aronnax. The usage of an observant intellectual to explain the dark pathos of a main character was rather popular in that era (think Watson and Holmes).In this instance it is important because Nemo destroys a vessel with all hands and then bows before a picture of his wife and children.

'Befiddled' was one of them.This novel is clearly Pedro De Alcantara's attempt at subtly spreading the Alexander Method through writing. Regardless of how effective the Alexander Method is, Alcantara's writing just doesn't send the message to me to go out and try it. While I seemed to \"get the idea\" about the Alexander Method, it was in some quite strange ways through the use of the dog, Mara. This was even further pushed when Becky \"becomes\" the dog at her audition. Her barking at others doesn't really seem to connect with me. It felt like he visualized one way to spread the word (in this case, through dog language) and it ended up as a clumsy and unconvincing explanation.I was also distracted by the strange \"relationship\" between Becky and Mr. Freeman; if not a little unlikely, it in a way unintentionally disturbing. While the idea was genuine, the entire relationship was perhaps maybe a bit overexaggerated and dramatic--the situation in which Becky and Mr. Freeman \"have a moment\" through Mr. Freeman's tears and Becky's heartful, \"I love you Mr. Freeman,\" was maybe just expressed in an awkward way.Overused but cute music\/composer-related punches here and there help to set the classical music mood, and Becky's school life with classmates is also a key element that will help this book relate with kids.Overall, the novel is moderately good. Alcantara has written something to stir a child's heart and crack a few smiles, especially if they are musical. However, there just seems to be a little something missing in this story...that little something that makes a book a bestseller, which Alcantara most likely has a better grip on as a musician.","sentiment_score":0.6},{"review":"John Vornholt creates a haunted setting for this spooky story.

Frankl is a famous Austrian psychiatrist well known for the invention of a new way of treating psychiatric ailments called logotherapy. Logotherapy strives to make the patient understand the purpose and meaning of his\/her life. The meaning may differ from one person to another. It differs from the previous popular psychiatric theories based on the pleasure of sex by Freud and the urge for power by Adler. \"Man's search for meaning\" is a book which explains how Fankl survived concentration camps which lead to the eventual development of logotherapy.I read this book a few weeks back. This book is effectively divided into three parts. First part explains the tough conditions faced by Frankl in the Nazi concentration camps in Auschwitz and Dachau. Second part provides the realizations of Frankl through his experiences in extreme conditions of concentration camps. It provides in a nutshell the treatment of basic psychic ailments through logotherapy. Frankl and his students have treated millions of people using logotherapy and some of the instants are narrated in this part. Third part of the book includes a lecture given by Frankl which got appended to the book later as an overview of logotherapy.This book though a bit too hectic read to start with, poses some of the vital questions. How to find meaning of one's life even in highly improbable extreme situations? How to keep faith on oneself that the suffering would soon end, even if the conditions do not seem so? Why did not all the members of the concentration camp commit suicide? What impulse drove them to survive unrecoverable tortures imposed on them by the Nazis? How could the inmates of concentration camp cope up with the fear of being put in a gas chamber any moment? All these questions are elegantly answered in this wonderful book through search for meaning.Frankl gives instances how he helped the inmates of the camp even when he was suffering himself. Frankl also provides glimpses of the later treatments he provided to some of his patients which directed them to realize the real meaning of their life. Frankl makes it very clear that there is no such thing called universal meaning for every one's life. The meaning of life differs from one individual to another. The meaning can be anything like one's love for parents, affinity towards some God, completion of professional duty, etc. While in the camp, Frankl was driven by his love for wife and the psychotherapy book which was incomplete. Logotherapy can just direct one towards identifying that meaning of his\/her life. It is for the individual to take the lead and live to fulfill that meaning.Though I have heard about the theories of Freud and Adler, I have not read their works. But after reading this book, I felt Frankl's logotherapy to be much more effective in facing life's challenges. The very fact that Frankl lived for more than 90 years even after going through the tortures of Nazi concentration camp, supports his theory quite well. The book is lucidly written though not much coherent. However, this book is highly recommended as it provides a detailed account of one of the foremost technique in psychotherapy and makes it accessible to any common man. I am sure every reader will get some different insight on life after completing this book.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"In the tales that Dr. Yalom relates in this book, he shares the accounts of his patients' problems, however, and more profoundly he shares a great deal of himself and how he responds to these problems.

Adams created a believable rabbit society, with its own daily matters, natural rhythms, social hierarchy, and mythology.

It's an accessible read for younger people, but it contains plenty of adult concerns. My only minor criticism is the absence of significant female characters (though, to be fair, this is a plot point), but, other than that, this 1972 novel remains as timeless as it was when I first read it.The audiobook narrator isn't a standout, but he does a decent enough job.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Although this book is almost 20 years old its detailed andfully referenced facts on how our national debt ismasterfully misrepresented by our government is an irrefutablefulfilment of prophecy of our present debt crisis.Learn how Shiff, who testified before congress in oppositionto the removal of gold and silver backed currency has beenvindicated on all accounts.

Although the sport certainly was thriving in Spain before Hemingway's novel, it was he who helped introduce bullfighting to the world. Yet, his book could not have had such an impact if it was not imbued with a compelling story, vivid descriptions, and powerful imagery.Hemingway explores the aimless lives and sexual exploits of Jake and his fellow compatriots in 1920s Paris. Veterans of World War I, these are members of the \"Lost Generation\", who spent their youth in foxholes in abominable conditions and have never fully recovered. Jake, literally, is impotent from a war wound, and the others show scars in their emotions and relationships with each other. Although there are no flashbacks to their horrific experiences, it is evident that the war weighs down on their minds and has had a profound impact on their philosophy of life. Although on the surface their carefree, promiscuous lifestyle may lend a sense of joy and fulfillment, despair and depression lie just beneath their surface, as evidenced by their excessive alcohol abuse. It is rare that either Jake or one of his cohorts are not intoxicated.Although Jake may be literally impotent, the other male characters show a symbolic impotence in their approach toward their lives. The sexpot, Brett, has a tenuous hold on them, as she is the reason of the moment to live. Yet, their affairs with Brett ultimately leaves them cold and distant. Cohn, an ex-boxer and currently a writer of Jewish descent, is a scapegoat for all that goes wrong in their lives. Although he is no choir boy, Cohn becomes a punching bag for the others, both literally and figuratively, as their frustrations mount. The heightened sense of hostilities between Cohn and the others is not because of his Jewish heritage, but because of their own insecurities with their manhood, a direct result of the life-altering war.Hemingway uses a direct, no-nonsense approach in his writing. There is neither flowery prose nor endless paragraphs of illustrative descriptions. Hemingway's words are power-packed and provide the most poignant imagery in the least amount of words. Hemingway does not mince words. It is his direct style that is, perhaps, his greatest asset, and that which has gained him fame.Hemingway is at his best when describing the fiesta and bullfights with all its pomp and splendor. Even without a detailed description of the gore involved in bullfighting, Hemingway delivers to the reader a vivid and imaginative description of the event. A detailed picture is given of how the bulls are driven to their deaths, yet Hemingway maintains a tactful and elegant approach in his prose.Overall, \"The Sun Also Rises\" provides great insight into the \"Lost Generation\", while providing an entertaining account of the Pamplona \"Running of the Bulls\" and the ensuing bullfight. This may be one of Hemingway's earlier works, but it is certainly one of his best. Superb.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"This is the first book by Hamilton I have read.

However, this book falls short of being as good as &quot;Warrior's Woman&quot;.The beginning of the book is great; Dalden arriving on Earth and finds his lifemate. They then catch the bad guys in about the middle of the book.The rest of the book is Brittany's refusal to believe that everything Dalden tells her is the truth. She refuses to believe in the ship, the computer, the other barbarians, their planet, even their strange creatures have an explanation to her.

We could have seen Dalden chasing after her, perhaps rallying his planet to fight the Centurians to get her back. Perhaps that would have been a similar plot to &quot;Keeper of the Heart&quot;, but it would have been a much better page turner than what the book actually is, simply the disbelief of Brittany to an almost painful level of &quot;what heck was she thinking?!&quot;This book started out with promise, but ended on a flat note.

I couldn't stop laughing while reading these early comics, and not only were they highly entertaining, but they also brought back memories of some scary times in recent memory, like all of the knee-jerk jingoism after 9\/11 and everything going on in the political world. Aaron McGruder has a lot of guts to express what many people are feeling but don't say for fear of rubbing certain people the wrong way or starting a big political argument. Like the one letter-writer he references at the beginning, I too was kind of disappointed that the DuBois family disappears about midway through, but I also agree with Mr. McGruder that when you're writing a comic strip, you can't really have so many main characters and stories the way you can with a book. All of the characters are so funny, well-written, and like people one might know in real life. While my favorite character from the tv show, the hilariously over the top Uncle Ruckus, isn't in the comics, there are still a lot of favorites here to choose from--the cantankerous but loveable Granddad, the politically opinionated and aware Huey, Riley, who wants to be some kind of miniature gangster and live like in a rap video, even though he's just a little kid who doesn't know anything about the world, Tom the attorney, Caesar, Huey's best friend who moved from Brooklyn and finds it just as difficult to be one of a handful of African-Americans in the middle of suburbia, and the racially confused Jazmine.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Loss can be experienced, but never fully understood, Perhaps some revelation may come from the tumult of feeling, yet thechaotic jumble of diverse,conflicting emotions as a whole defies conscious, rational description. W. Somerset Maugham, someone who can be considered a master of introspective narrative, covered virtually the whole range of human emotion in \"Of Human Bondage\", yet failed to satisfactorarily explore grief over bereavement. Joan Didion in her Amazon.com Editors' Top Pick of 2005 nonfiction work \"The Year of Magical Thinking\" fell far short. Perhaps loss cannot be explained so much as put into perspective, either through the chronicling of its immediate impact, or its gradual dissipitation from consciousness.Or perhaps I haven't read enough on the subject, a possibility which is admittedly as high as that of my conjectures being correct. However, \"A Death in the Family\" goes some way in remedying this deficit.A Pulitzer Prize winner, \"A Death in the Family\" covers the short time span from just before the father of a family leaves on a journey in which he suddenly dies in a car accident, until his funeral.The thoughts and interactions between many characters central and peripheral to the incident, including his wife, their children, as well as the in-laws are painstakingly and vividly rendered, delining a portrait of - as the title plainly states - a death in the family.Unable to come to grips with the enormity of grief, the widow's mind first turns to irreverent matters (the blasphemy of trying out a mourning veil in front of the mirror before the funeral) and then to finding solace in her religion. The narrative gist regarding religion on the part of the author registers as part bafflement,and part sheer anger and frustration at the what he percieves as docile, imbecilic submission to such obvious capriciousness. \"God, if You exist, come here and let me spit in Your face.\", he has one character think.Such irreverency and inadequecy of mortal thought in face of something as unfathomable as death is convincing and uncontrived, as are the innocence of the dead man's children. ('Could I call myself a half-orphan?'wonders the son, thinking to impress his schoolmates.)Reading such a novel gives one a sense of catharsis, as well as something like the euphoria one has in waking from a nightmare.

It has lots of the old favorites from &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; (including &quot;Homecoming,&quot; the monologue that most people seem to remember), somewhat rewritten as short stories. Funny, sometimes poignant, these are humor pieces at their best, with a surprising depth of characterization and the wonderful, slightly bemused, slightly awed voice of a master story teller. Of all the Lake Wobegon collections, this one is probably the most representative, because it is the most balanced. Belly laughs and a tear or two, although as Keillor insists, his view of Lake Wobegon really is NOT that nostalgic, and usually it's free of sentimentality","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Peter Rheinhart's books are also good, but if I had to have just one and only one book on artisan bread baking Bread Alone would be the one.

Rifling through the pages, absorbing the words printed in ink, takes us back to that long childhood summer of Douglas and his younger brother, Tom Spaulding as if we were lapping the sweet intoxicating magical drink that captures time itself stamped and dated on each reused ketchup bottle.Every section heading (for there are no chapters, only events to mark the passing of summer days) is marked with a dandelion--a flower to fill Grandpa Spaulding's glass jar wall with the memories of summer. The novel follows the adolescent Doug on his journey through another summer as ever more memorable than the last. But this summer has an extra special something to it. It is the summer Douglas Spaulding first felt alive.Ray Bradbury takes us on another childhood adventure where the next leap could land you in the mysterious forgetful days of adulthood. His writing fills the reader with a sense of excitement and wonder as his atmosphere builds itself inside of you until you can no longer remember whose memories you experience and long for--your own, or those of an imagined boy eating lime ice cream on a hot July day or putting pennies in the machine for Madame Tarot's fortune telling during the dwindling days of August.This was a wonderful novel of insightful discoveries with a exuberance and celebration of life found only in a Bradbury novel. I highly recommend you add this, Dandelion Wine to your shelves to admire and pull down on cold winter nights. Whether it's the weather that has you down or something deeper, something hidden within the self has wrapped icy fingertips around your heart, take down Dandelion Wine, open it up, and experience the wonderful and magical Summer of 1928.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is a classic tale of loyalty and friendship.

I bought the book on the strength of the first few pages, when the main character, Isabella, rides with her father through the autumn woods of New England. She's enchanted, and so was I. And when her little escort is attacked, it brings to mind scenes from the 'Last of the Mohicans' movie, which, given the dedication, seems deliberate. And that's alright; good movie, that was.The trouble I had with the story came with the developing relationship between Isabella and Wusamequin, her captor. The story is a retelling of Beauty and the Beast, so I was expecting romance, and it's there. Problem is, it seems contrived, even considering the outlines of the original story. The main thing that Isabella and Wusamequin have in common is their mutual ability to heal people using spirit medicine. And that's a big thing, but they're up against some fairly big factors: the mutual enmity of their people, culture shock, personal violence, and war. Holder tries to get around this using the 'soulmates drawn mysteriously together' thing, along with what looks like a large helping of Stockholm syndrome, but it feels entirely too fast. There's a lot of \"I like him\/her and I don't know why;\" truth told, I don't know why either. Both characters are likable, in their own ways; both are honorable, and fairly believable (if very heroic) on their own. It's the romance that feels forced. And in a story that is fundamentally romantic, that's wrong, somehow. A little extra time for them to get to know each other would not have gone amiss.Read this book on a rainy day.

In the end, `Four Weddings...' works rather nicely, and while it's not the best British comedy in my opinion (I prefer screenwriter Richard Curtis' very own `Love Actually'), it is very enjoyable and worthy of most the love and accolades it has received.The film revolves around a group of friends who discover love, friendship and life over the course of four weddings and a funeral (or should I say, `three weddings, a funeral and half a wedding' to be more precise). At the center of this group is Charles, a bachelor who is afraid of commitment. His commitment phobia seems to fade away when he meets the mysteriously elusive American, Carrie, at a wedding. They have a moment and then she is gone and he can't stop thinking about her. The remainder of the film follows Charles as he tries to reconnect with Carrie, obstacle after obstacle falling into his path.I've read another review recently that mentioned how Andie MacDowell was perfectly cast as Carrie for the very fact that she is a boring actress, and her lack of natural charm made Charles interest in her all the more interesting. I can agree. I have never found MacDowell to be a particularly intriguing actress, that is for sure, but here she draws me in, mostly because I find myself trying to see what Charles sees in her.The film is littered with wonderfully full performances, especially by Hugh Grant and Kristen Scott Thomas, but no one can really be singled out as `worst-in-show' since everyone involved rises to the occasion and hands the audience a wonderful experience. Grant though, should be singled out as `best-in-show' for he really personifies what he has been trying to personify since he first appeared on the big screen. Some actors are always given a hard time for constantly playing variations of the same character. Some do so wonderfully, others not so wonderfully. Grant has made a career of, rather wonderfully, playing the commitment phoebe that unintentionally pushes everyone away with his arrogance. Charles is the perfect example of this character because Grant has softened him to the point where his arrogance is an understatement and his gentle nature is his major selling point. I am still baffled at the fact that Grant has yet to receive an Academy Award nomination, for he is constantly effortless in his roles and typically stands out in every film he inhabits as `best-in-show'. Kristen Scott Thomas is also edible as Fiona, capturing the comedy within the script effortlessly, and inhabiting her character with real warmth and genuine heart. Her secret desires for Charles help create a three dimensional character who is both easy to love and easy to understand.It must be said that Richard Curtis knows how to pen a winning comedy. His style of wit and poignancy help elevate `Four Weddings and a Funeral' from a generic romantic comedy to something much deeper and ultimately much more memorable. He has a knack for giving his characters something to sink their teeth into, something to really embellish and deliver to the audience. He creates characters that we can feel connected to, and we truly feel connected to the ones presented us in `Four Weddings...'.In the end `Four Weddings and a Funeral' is a feel good romantic comedy that hits almost every mark and delivers a beautifully fulfilling cinematic experience. It has its faults, sure, and it misses the mark in some areas, but not every film is aimed at perfection. What every film is aimed at though is entertainment, and `Four Weddings and a Funeral' definitely entertains.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"This book has a weird effect- it is utterly preposterous yet you believe every word.

Most authors who use the old \"main character with amnesia\" hook gradually return pieces of the past, eventually leading up to a final revelation that clears up all confusion. Perry is a brave author, she leaves her protagonist and the reader with fewer clues and more questions than they started with.The Face of a Stranger begins in a squalid hospital in Victorian England, where a patient has just woken from a coma. Having no memory of who he is or why he is there, he is shaken and fearful of what he might learn. Soon enough it comes to light that he is William Monk, a police officer who lost his memory in a violent carriage accident. Rather than admit he has no memory of his former life and risk losing his job, he returns to work and is immediately placed on the puzzling murder of a prominent English gentleman. As he investigates the case, he also searches for some recollection of his former life. Through the eyes of people he once knew, he learns that he was not a very nice man, in fact even he doesn't like his former self. One thing is undeniable though, he was an excellent crime solver and his skills are one thing that he has managed to retain. The only allies he has are his partner, John Evan, and a young nurse fresh home from the Crimean war, Hester Latterly. Evan seems to genuinely like Monk, while Hester can barely stand him. Together, they must piece together the solution to the case before all of London is calling for Monk's resignation.I can't explain what it is about this book that interests me. I'm not a big fan of historical fiction, but the interesting plot is a good point in Anne Perry's favor. William Monk is a very captivating lead, and Hester Latterly is a formidable foil for him. I'll definitely be picking up the next book.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Hurston spend much of her life collecting and transcribing the traditions and stories of African Americans and Caribbean cultures. In addition to her volumes on folklore and ethnology, she wrote four novels and several stories and coauthored a play with Langston Hughes, all of which drew heavily on the material she collected for her studies and on events from her own life. Of her works of fiction, \"Their Eyes Were Watching God\" is undoubtedly her best and, after reading it a second time, I have even more admiration for her accomplishment.One of the reasons the book resonates today with so many readers is the story's major theme: the difficulty of reconciling the struggle between social approval and well-being, on the one hand, and passion and self-respect, on the other. The heroine, Janie, must often do what is expected of her (by her grandmother, her husbands, or the community) at the expense of her own pleasure.Yet Hurston intends to do more than tell a simple story of a Southern black woman looking for Mr. Right. The author introduces characters and sketches that have less to do with the advancement of the plot and more to do with creating an environment: what life was like for black communities in Florida during the early twentieth century--the humor and the resentment, the misery and the fortitude, the camaraderie and the backstabbing. Characteristic of this leisurely documentary method is the manner in which the town's older inhabitants razz one another or the tale of Matt and his yellow mule, which manages to be at once funny, appalling, touching, and inspiring. All in all, the use of dialect and the meandering style make this novel not an \"easy read\" but a rewarding one.It saddens me that so many high school students are required to read this book. (I can relate: an exposure to \"Julius Caesar\" in the ninth grade instilled in me a loathing of Shakespeare that took me a decade to overcome.) This is a book to be savored like fine wine, not administered like cough syrup. An exceptional teacher with a classroom of widely-read students (as in AP English) might well succeed in stimulating enthusiasm for the story of Janie and Tea Cake, but it's certainly not a book meant to be crammed in a night's panic in order to answer a series of exam questions.For those readers young and old who do enjoy \"Their Eyes Were Watching God,\" I also recommend Hurston's first novel, \"Jonah's Gourd Vine,\" which portrays the same period and communities while recounting episodes based very closely on the author's own childhood.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I thought at first this book must have been written in the early 1990s because the descriptions of San Francisco are spot on.

The fun starts with a tournament that reads just like the tournament in Disney's 1973 Robin Hood, and ends with the blurb on the back cover of my Penguin classic, \"The brave and noble knight Ivanhoe returns from the Crusades to claim his bride, Princess Rowena. But King John has usurped the English crown from his absent brother, Richard the Lionheart. Before Ivanhoe can wed his love, he must first help Richard regain the throne...\" The fun in the blurb, of course, is recognized after reading the book - specifically, where does Ivanhoe help Richard do anything?Marketing license aside, Ivanhoe has some great moments. It is, however, largely a loosely connected collection of anecdotes covering a large array of characters rather than anything as focused as Ivanhoe helping Richard regain his throne. In fact, I'd say competitive bigotry - Christian\/Jew, Norman\/Saxon, Church\/State - and crossing those boundaries, is a more telling theme and plot narrative than Richard vs John for the throne of England.The loose-connectedness of Ivanhoe makes it, at times, a pain to read, and there is a lot of context setting, probably 19th Century politics in nature, that causes the book to drag. The arcane language also demands more patience and concentration than novels from a similar period - that may, however, be more a function of the fact that I read Dumas and Hugo in translation, rather than in the original.All said, I enjoyed Ivanhoe for the most part. The conflict - physical and ideological - is interesting, although the book carries a fair amount of baggage in (lack of) plot cohesion and contextual filler.","sentiment_score":0.6},{"review":"Out of the clear blue I decided to look this cookbook up and see if it was still listed as available. Sadly, it can only be found occasionally; but if you can locate one, you will not be sorry to add it to your collection.In the 70s I frequented Camden, Maine on my vacations, when you could still find kitschy little places to eat and drink for reasonable prices. Yorkie's was such a place.

Dorian's charm is also appreciated by Lord Henry, a rascally fellow, able to twist phrases and morals with his sly tongue. His winsome ways captivate Dorian, but Dorian soon finds himself pulled in the direction of a beautiful actress as well. These two loves tear Dorian in different directions, resulting in unexpected turns of events that send him down a road of sin and pleasure, though never with the rewards of true happiness. As his actions lead to even more drastic results, he finds himself fearing every shadow and questioning his own sanity.These events do not occur in a vacuum. With Dorian's sliding moral state, the portrait of his beauty begins reflecting the dark decay in his soul. Even as his own face refuses to age or show corruption, the painting becomes uglier by the day. Dorian is both fascinated and appalled by this. When, at last, he faces the consequences of his own selfish choices, he makes one final decision to try to destroy the evidence.I laughed aloud at many parts, particularly early in the book, then found the tone growing eerie and black. What a thought-provoking book! And one that kept my attention throughout. This is no glossed-over portrait of Mr. Gray, but a grisly depiction of evil--even when it masquerades in a cloak of civility.Oscar Wilde joined other writers of his day--H.G. Wells, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Joseph Conrad--in wrestling with concepts of the soul and the senses in the light of scientific discoveries. What about the conscience? Where did theology and psychology fit in? What about free will? In the last few pages, Wilde paints his own sobering portrait of a man who has tried to live as though the soul and senses have no effect on each other.This now ranks as one of my favorite classic novels. The results of Dorian Gray's experiment serve as a mirror for all those who consider themselves holy, heathen, or hypocrite.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"When A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was originally published in 1943, it was a huge success, and Betty Smith's book became an instant classic. It is about several years in the life of the Nolan family in the early 20th century and it is mostly about the coming-of-age of the main character, Francie Nolan. It is that rare novel that can be enjoyed by both teenagers and adults.This book very definitely has its own style, I think partly because it was written as a memoir and changed into a novel. Smith obviously poured her heart into this book. Her other novels are charming, but they don't have the depth of this book. Because Smith could fictionalize apparently real people, she could flesh out the characters until they seem like real people, not characters in a novel. Sometimes even minor characters are given thoughts and feelings, as how they relate to the main characters in the book.A strong point of the novel is its sense of place. Smith even describes in detail the neighborhood. the neighbors and everyday life until you feel are actually in the Brooklyn of 100 years ago. The novel opens by describing Brooklyn in 1912:\"Serene was a word you could put to Brooklyn, New York. Especially in the summer of 1912. Somber, as a word, was better. But it did not apply to Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Prairie was lovely and Shenandoah had a beautiful sound, but you couldn't fit those words into Brooklyn. Serene was the only word for it; especially on a Saturday afternoon in the summer.\"The women are the stronger people in the book. Many of the male characters are weak-willed, while the women persevere. Francie Nolan, the main character, is the daughter of Johnny and Katie Nolan and the sister of Neeley. Francie is a fully-realized character. Francie is a strong person, who you know will do well in life.Katie, the mother, is very hard-working. She cleans apartment buildings for a living. She is scrubbing floors when she is an advanced state of pregnancy. Katie refuses anything that smacks of \"charity.\" One wonders what she would think of Section 8, food stamps, free school lunches, and WIC. Sometimes there is no food in the house, and the children go hungry.Johnny Nolan, the father, is a singing waiter, but has no steady job. He mostly works at one-shot jobs like weddings and parties. Johnny is an alcoholic. There was little understanding or treatment of alcoholism when Smith wrote the book. We now know that alcoholism is a disease, with both powerful psychological as well as physical components. So even though Johnny is lovable, and really loves his children, he is perceived as weak and a loser. Johnny comes from a long line of alcoholics; perhaps his problems were at least partially due to a genetic disposition toward the disease.Francie senses that her mother loves Neeley more, but she eventually comes to peace with it. This does not mean that her mother doesn't love her, of course she does. It is partly because Neeley is reminiscent of the father and Katie does not want him to turn out the same way. Francie is like her mother in that she is strong and smart, but she has also inherited her father's creative ability and his dreaminess. One of the main differences between Francie and her father is that Francie takes action, and Katie admires that. Francie works hard at school and at her various jobs, and in improving upon her hardscrabble beginnings.The novel does have flaws. Some of the psychoanalyzing and character analysis is quite dated. Women are thwarted by \"starved love instincts.\" However, I find the book to be mostly very strong, especially about the characterization of Francie. She is a completely realized character. You feel as if you know her. The book takes her from an eleven-year-old child to a young woman about to leave Brooklyn and start new adventures. Even though she is going far away, she will never really leave Brooklyn behind:\"She might get rid of her Brooklyn accent that way. But Francie didn't want to get rid of it any more than she wanted to get rid of her name. It meant that she belonged some place. She was a Brooklyn girl with a Brooklyn name and a Brooklyn accent. She didn't want to change into a bit of this and a bit of that.\"You just wish that there had been a sequel.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Hi everyone,I found this book to be of great help to my better understanding of what is going on with my 9-year-old daughter, who suffers from Asperger's, and what I can do to make things easier for her, myself and the people around us.

Enter the world of Gabriel and Spencer and be transported to New York in the 1950s - an era of white gloves and house parties, old patrician families and rebellious scions, ageless social rituals rubbed at the edges by the new realities of life after World War II. In this heady world Gabriel,age 17, learns more in a few months than he can hope to have learned in years at the exclusive and stuffy boarding school from which he has been expelled. The inspiration for his education is Lillian Dawes, a mysterious and somewhat penniless heroine, in the style of Edith Wharton, who glides comfortably among both rich and poor with a beauty and charm that makes slaves of them all. She has a hidden past that speaks of danger and privation. She has an impetuous bravery that puts the rich and powerful to shame. She inspires in Gabriel a love that threatens to tear him apart from his fascinating older brother with whom Lillian falls reluctantly in love during this special summer in Greenwich Village.Katherine Mosby writes in a lyrical style that is both easy to read and truly exquisite.

I can't speak highly enough of it. It deserves more than five stars. So now I urge you to read it.The book's subtitle is deceiving. It gave me the impression that this was a collection of different news stories. I couldn't imagine how a bunch of news stories about Rwanda could be \"riveting.\" So I borrowed the book from the public library because I didn't want to buy a book that I might find dull.The book *is* riveting. Now that I've read it, I want to buy it.Each story builds *the* story. The author's comments on the stories and the way he relates the history add so much to it. Unlike a history book, _We wish to inform you_ doesn't just spit out facts; the facts are personalized.My only criticism is that this book really should have included an acronym list. Part 2 contained so many acronyms that, although they were initially spelled out, I had a hard time remembering which meant what.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"The Sudoku book came as advertized and at a REAL bargain price. looked new and was sent out promptly.

The Protectors don't fit quite comfortably into the &quot;Known Space&quot; Universe, and have raised some problems later, for example in the famous &quot;Man-Kzin Wars,&quot; where the &quot;Known Space&quot; universe has been shared by other writers, including Poul Anderson, Jerry Pournelle, SM Stirling and Hal Colebatch, but the story is fine space opera and entertainment, and has a genuine sense of strangeness and wonder that all too often is lacking from contemporary SF.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This is the first Miss Marple stories and set the stage for the rest of the series. Miss Jane Marple is an elderly spinster of modest means,a life-long resident of the tiny village of St. Mary Mead, an advid gardener and bird watcher and a most astute observer of human nature. Many of the residents and visitors of St. Mary Mead that will return in later works are introduced here, the gentle vicar and his lively younger wife, Raymond West, Jane's novelist nephew and others.The story is told by the vicar and gives us many insights into his homelife. Col. Protheroe is found murdered in the vicarage, much to the delight of his wife and daughter and embarrassment of the vicar. As the local police try to solve the crime it become apparent that Col. Protheroe was not going to be missed and that nobody really had an alibi. As the investigation progresses it seems that more questions are raised than answered. Ultimately it is Miss Marple who resolves the issues of love affairs, mysterious strangers, and assorted lies to uncover the true culprit.This is a perfect gem, Christie at her best. The characters are well written and the descriptions of the lack of privacy in a small are incredibly accurate and a recurring theme of Christie's. In typical Christie style of the rules of detection are flirted with but the clues are fairly laid out for the reader to follow, if they can be separated from the red herrings.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Well, I'm not sure if it's accurate to call Dorothy Sayers' writing \"campy,\" but this novel is certainly full of wit and campanology: the art and science of bell ringing. Although I had heard church bells ringing out before I read The Nine Tailors (the name of a pattern of church bell ringing), I had NO IDEA that in parts of England (and maybe elsewhere) there were such devotees! In fact, I knew pretty much nothing about bell ringing -- but I sure learned a lot about it from this novel. The experience was pleasant. I enjoyed the mystery, the setting, the characters, the humor, and the plot. And I was very satisfied with myself when I figured out an important part of the solution, one based on the bells.This is a long book and, at times it might seem longer than it really is due to the information about bell ringing. But the plot is very well constructed and the book is very worth reading.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I'm going to be completely honest here in my assessment of this book. I've been growing bamboo for many years and i once worked for one of the only bamboo nurseries in the USA with a quarantine license. I had hoped this book would have been more. I give Michael Bell some credit for his work, but overall i just was not happy with this book. There are alot of topics in the book that seem RUSHED or that just aren't covered in depth which would have made this book really worthwhile. A good deal of the book is devoted to what he calls an A to Z of Bamboo plant descriptions, but i found this list to be grossly deficient. Some species have only a sentence or two, maybe a very small short paragraph, as a description! Some aren't even listed! Some of them aren't even very accurate or are very generalized and \"RUSHED\". Even more, the author is very biased towards certain species which seem to have clouded his judgement when reviewing others. Further more, some of the information in this book is just plainly false. Especially where potted plants are concerned, which isn't covered in much depth at all. The book has a very \"RUSHED\" little section on diseases\/insects, which is disappointing with any plant or gardening book. Overall, the book has a \"RUSHED\" sense about it and in some areas is just plainly wrong or misguiding (telling us certain plants don't do well in pots when they do, or that certain plants grow to this size when they are in fact taller, or that certain plants don't seed or flower when they do and have in recent years). It has some nice pictures but you should definitely purchase a more thorough book on the subject. I gave it 2 stars for effort. I'm sure glad i purchased a few other books to compliment this one.

It world depicted within the pages of this book resembles the world we know today rather than the world of the nineteen thirties, when this book was written.It is a world in which women are sexually liberated and are not looked at askance for having multiple sexual relationships. People are programmed at birth to be satisfied with the status quo. One's future is predetermined. Most are satisfied and, of course, there is soma, an addictive substance that induces euphoria.There are a few renegades, however, who are not satisfied, for whom the pre-programming just did not take. These free thinkers have questions that they want answered. They are individualistic in a world where the individual is sublimated to the grand scheme of things that is firmly in place. They simply do not feel that they belong in such a world. They will soon find out what happens to those who do not conform.This is a book that provides a great deal of food for thought, which is why it has remained a classic in its genre.

The style is `chatty' with a couple of funny quipps thrown in, but very to the point and un-pretentious.

Tolkien's \"Tree and Leaf\" originally included two items - one an extended essay, \"On Fairy Tales,\" the other an intriguing short story, \"Leaf by Niggle.\" The essay yields insight into Tolkien's theory of the \"subcreation\" which underlies the fictional world of fantasy (both his and that of others), and has a good bit of Christian theology incorporated into it as well. The short story tells of an artist who wants most of all to be left alone in his creating, and a neighbor whose need impinges upon the artist's time, energy, and, ultimately, art itself. Poignant, telling and essential for understanding Tolkien's experience of art-making and life.Unique to the HarperCollins (British) \"Tree by Leaf\" edition noted here is the inclusion of the 148-line poem \"Mythopoeia\" which, according to Christopher Tolkien's preface, Tolkien composed in response to C. S. Lewis' having \"described myth and fairy-story as 'lies'.\" Also included is \"The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth,\" an ending Tolkien supplied to an Old English tale, \"The Battle of Maldon.\" Those drawn to these works may find Paul Kocher's chapter, \"Seven Leaves,\" from his \"Master of Middle Earth,\" of particular interest. Furthermore, Tom Shippey's introduction to \"Tales from the Perilous Realm\" links themes from \"On Fairy Tales\" and \"Leaf by Niggle\" to such Tolkien translations as \"Sir Orfeo,\" not included in the collections cited above.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"If you ask ten people who have read William Golding's Lord of the Flies, half of those people will say that they loved it or \"thought it wasn't that bad\" and other five will say that they despised it. I am one of those who despised it. There are definitely some good, maybe even great qualities of Lord of the Flies and the allegorical and symbolic meanings that are hidden throughout the book are important and a good thing to study in class yet, if I was given this and say, War and Peace, I would grab War and Peace in a second. The truth to why I dislike LotF so very much is a bit complicated. This book opens on a boy wandering around an island. You are given almost no information on where this boy(or the other boys who show up later) came from. There are little bits of information of their back story stuck in the book almost randomly. Unless you are paying a lot of attention to every word that Golding writes, it is easy to miss these precious details. That is not the only reason that this is not may favorite book in the world. I'm not sure if Golding purposely did this or if this is just the way he happened to write it, but the the majority of the characters seem to be purely evil and it is quite hard to read the book without feeling you have personal grudge against each one. I won't go into intimate details (just so you can read it yourself and understand the disgust I have with these boys) but each boy acts in a certain way that makes you wonder how evil a child can be when not under any kind of adult supervision or guidance. In conclusion, if you would like to buy this book, I warn you. You may be one of the ones who like it and shrug off the savagery of the boy or you could be one who can't even stand to finish it.

While without the power and emotion of Poisonwood, The Bean Trees is a charming novel nonetheless.Taylor Greer comes from a small town in rural Kentucky. Pittman is decades behind the rest of the country, and the only thing for teenage girls to do is to become pregnant. Knowing she has to escape this environment, Taylor packs her things into a ramshackle car, and decides that she will travel until her car breaks down. While on her journey, a Cherokee woman literally drops a baby into her car, and Taylor must now think of what's best not only for herself, but also this little girl. She finally ends up in Tucson, and makes a life for herself there.Taylor is not brilliant, but she overflows with good old common sense. She is also inquisitive and open minded-two traits that endear her to those around her. Once she lands in Tucson, she is befriended by a number of people (who each possess as kind a heart as Taylor) and she creates a substitute family. Also, while Taylor does not seem like a religious person, she is a spiritual one and can see God's presence all around here.While The Bean Trees does not have a riveting plot, it is very rich in imagery. Kingsolver was a biologist before she became an author, and some of her descriptions are priceless. I especially enjoyed the first rain in the desert, and the blooming of the night cereus. So for a charming and heartwarming story, you can't go wrong with The Bean Trees.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"As has often been noted, this novel was written before Conrad's period of greatness. Perhaps it doesn't measure up in psychological depth to such books as \"The Secret Sharer\", \"Heart of Darkness\", \"The Secret Agent\" or \"Lord Jim\", but written by anyone else, it would elevate them into the ranks of Great Literature. A scandal leads to the dismissal of a trusted agent for a Dutch trader in what is now Indonesia. His Eurasian wife, with whom relations have never been close, rejects him; he has to leave town. Looking for revenge for what he feels is an unfair dismissal, Willems, the former agent, plans to reveal a trade secret to an Arab rival. This, in the 19th century, was more than a business doublecross, it was a betrayal of \"the blood\". Colonialism was always about race and blood, so modern readers should understand that this is a subtext of the book. Various Malay pirates and rogues get involved. Almayer, a Dutch buyer stationed up a remote jungle river,(who appears in other Conrad novels) develops an unmitigated hatred of Willems. I should not reveal the denouement here, but believe me, it is melodramatic enough. Lots of jungle and thunderstorm atmosphere, Nature looms omnipotent in the background, not under threat from Man as in most of today's discourse.Motivations in some cases remain a bit murky and sudden jumps in time help the author avoid explaining what might have transpired. Still, Willems, the eventual outcast, fallen from grace with his employers, become an object of scorn to his fellow Europeans in the town (probably Makassar, now Ujung Pandang in Sulawesi), is a conflicted character worthy of Conrad's other novels. Capt. Lingard, his old benefactor, is too much a super-hero, a character way too big for his boots. He tries to help his former proteg&eacute;e, but eventually abandons him to his fate. Aissa, Willems' Malay lover, resembles the Dragon Lady a bit too much to be true-to-life, while the other Malay characters too seemed to be comic book or cardboard cut-out figures most of the time. The distraught Eurasian wife, weak and vacillating, is rather outr&eacute;. It's a good story, reflecting some of the historical patterns of the East Indies of that time. British and Dutch rivalry lasted for a long time. Arabs from the Hadramawt (now Yemen) emigrated to various European-dominated South East Asian societies and prospered mightily as middlemen and traders (see Engseng Ho's \"Graves of Tarim\", a historico-anthropological work). The rich Sayid Abdulla, plotting to take over the European trade network, is not an odd figure then. All in all, Conrad was impressive right from the start. This novel will definitely hold your attention. Couldn't give it less than four stars.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"This author kept me reading page by page, up most nights (when I should have been sleeping) reading and waiting to see what will happen next???I will happily read more books by Ms. Girard.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I must admit I agree with the less-favorable of the reviews listed here, even though I tried hard to like this book. The synopsis sounded interesting to me--one hundred years in the life of a hand-made accordion, passed on from generation to generation, ethnicity to ethnicity. A grand idea, mini-series material. My curiosity was piqued. I had to admire any author who had the guts to tackle such a project.Unfortunately, this was not a book that gripped me. It did not make me want to stay up late to read it or go out and recommend it to everyone I know; it did not give me any new and interesting insights into the human condition. Basically, it did not make me *feel* much.What I did like about the book was Proulx's command of the language. Every once in a while, I would read a sentence and think, &quot;wow,&quot; which does make me optimistic enough to want to try Proulx's other novels.Throughout the book, Proulx finishes with a character by summarizing the rest of his or her life in one paranthetical paragraph. Each of the characters that are discarded in this way inevitably end up living a bizarre and unbelievably unlucky life and dying a strange death. I felt these were unnecessary and did not add anything to the book, except perhaps a feeling of triteness. These afterthoughts could have been written by anyone called upon to create a weird story; they didn't make me feel like I was getting to know a character any better.As a final note, I, too, felt that &quot;Accordion Crimes&quot; is not a novel but a series of short stories linked by a common element.

Probably caused by the satin ribbon bookmark that somehow pulled on the paper during production.The second occured during the Return of the King.

This is it. Most books on filmmaking technique either wax philosophical on the author's pet theories or get lost in gee-wiz-you-can-do-this-neat-trick-with-the-camera mania. There's little of either here; instead, you'll find a focused, highly readable series of lessons on what really matters most--how to communicate a meaningful message on film or video. Unlike some VERY annoying books that give examples of lighting and other techniques via badly drawn line-art, this book shows every technique with actual stills from video shoots so you can see how lighting, framing, lens use, etc. actually change the appearance and impact of a scene.There are also numerous references to excellent classic and modern films with quite specific suggestions for examining the techniques that make those films work so well. Perhaps most important of all, the authors never lose sight of the fact that filmmaking is about interpreting and creating a reality that evokes a meaningful and powerful experience for the audience.So if you want a book listing all the oh-so-tacky transitions and effects that your new NLE will do, or a thousand-page treatise on the history of film, THIS AIN'T IT.

Chein over almost an 85-year-period, this book is an absolute must to add to your library. The book is divided into 11 chapters with the first titled 'Toy Men' with a historical look at the men and women that formed and crafted the company named J Chein. The remaining 10 chapters list toys produced by J Chein by category such as 'Coney Island Baby', 'From the Funny Pages', and 'Saving Up [tin banks]' as examples. Heavily illustrated with wonderful color images, descriptions of the toys, size, production dates, and relative value. While I do not specialize in collecting J Chein, I was immediately able to find my pieces in this reference text. What is the downside to this book? Only two small things. First, being published in 1997 the catalogue values predate \"E-bay\" for the most part, and the range in values is not accompanied by a description of grading (good, very good, etc). In toys, the value is in % of paint remaining, color, and a complete item (e.g., trap for a bank). The second issue is that when a toy was reproduced over several decades with minor to moderate variations, it would have been nice to show each of these varities. Anyway, overall a great book!","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"First a little background information about the main players in this tale of cocaine, murder, egos, and Showbiz &quot;wannabes&quot; and &quot;ustawuzes.&quot;For starters there was Roy Radin, a modern day, but old fashioned, vaudeville entrepeneur. Radin got very rich producing vaudeville type productions that traveled a circuit of medium sized midwestern cities and towns as fund raisers for such organizations as police benevolent societies. The sponsoring societies did make money, but Radin usually made more. His shows and audiences were the sort that usually gave more applause and greater laughter to the trained dog act than to well-known entertainer, Joey Bishop.Oh, yes, Radin was also a binge eater and user of cocaine. These little habits often consumed a big part of his income.The second major player in this drama was Karen &quot;Laney&quot; Jacobs, later Laney Greenberger. It is a matter of public record, from her later pre-trial hearings, that Laney was a major cocaine distributor who did business with some very vicious people, and who ended up on trial herself for a very vicious murder.A third player, key to our story, was Robert Evans, a Hollywood movie producer who had produced some very successful movies but who, during the period covered by this book, was somewhat down on his luck.Additional players were various drug traffickers, dealers, gangsters, and hit men, as well as Laney's last husband, Larry Greenberger, who either was a retired businessman or a major player in the drug trade, depending on whose testimony one chooses to believe.It would seem that both Radin and Laney (then Greenberger) wanted to get into the legitimate movie producing business. To facilitate this desire, Laney introduced Radin to Robert Evans who had the rights to produce the movie &quot;Cotton Club,&quot; but who was unable, at that time, to get financing through normal channels. Radin, through use of his own money, and money from other sources, could provide this much needed financial backing.Laney's idea, when she made the introduction, was to form a production company consisting of Evans, Radin, and herself. This is the point where Radin made his very serious error in judgment. He decided to cut Laney out of the deal and to only pay her a $50,000 finder's fee. Laney didn't take kindly to this snub. Being a principal in the procuction company that made this film would have made her &quot;someone&quot; in Hollywood, and potentially could have been very profitable to the tune of millions.She didn't take this sort of thing lightly. One evening, she set up a dinner meeting with Radin to &quot;discuss&quot; their differences. He was last seen alive getting into her limousine. A month later his badly decomposed body was discovered, It had multiple bullet holes in the head.Her last husband was also guilty of using poor judgment, which evidently caused Laney to become angry with him. One day, with Laney upstairs in their large estate home in Florida, He managed to commit suicide in a most unusual manner. With a large caliber gun in his right hand, he somehow shot himself in the left temple with powder marks that indicated that, in addition to this unusual way of shooting himself on the wrong side of the head, he had managed to do it from six to eight feet away. Very long arms? He also managed to hold onto the gun, with his finger still on the trigger, even though the recoil should have caused him to drop it. A most amazing form of suicide.Since Laney was charged with Radin's murder and expedited to California, the investigation of this most unusual suicide was never completed.This all goes to show that, when dealing with a no-nonsense, tough as nails, female drug dealer, one really should try to use some degree of discretion.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"The Squared Circle by James W.

Was it really worth the time and expense to catch a bunch of small-time gun runners, dope sellers, and miscellaneous crimes such as wife abuse and various assaults? This isn't meant to demean the excellent undercover work by Bill Queen but as I read the book my first thought was whether it was really worth the time\/money not to mention risk to Bill Queen. For example one of the main gang members who Queen initially meets is Rocky. But he's not a major player. Abusive to his wife, can't hold a regular job, neglect bordering on child abuse and yes, he is a small time thief, gunrunner, drug user\/seller and miscellaneous assaults. At some points I found myself laughing at these overgrown adolescents who really just want a sense of brotherhood.And that is where the book is the best, describing the camaraderie of being a member of the club. When Queen's aunt (think quasi-mother) dies, he hits on how touched every member of the Mongols were but his ATF partners showed no such compassion, probably just because they are busy with their own lives. He also overlays how this time-consuming operation damaged his family relationships and eventually led to his ex-wife and kids being moved for fear of retribution. But the summation statement of this book is when the Mongol arrests start and a fellow Mongol calls to tell him they know who the snitch is and they are going to kill him. Unfortunately, they don't realize it is Queen so he has to disclose that he is the snitch to save the other member's life.Other than feeling that the story was somewhat exaggerated to make this mini-crooks look like the worst people in the world this is an entertaining book. Not the fastest read I've had but if you are like many Americans and fascinated by current day outlaws it is enjoyable.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"William Wallace's three Songbooks (Easy Piano) are a godsend to anyone working with keyboard players of any age or ability. For the novice player there are popular Standard (Public Domain) pieces with manageable left hand parts and yet well arranged enough to be attractive and catchy to play. These include 'Morning Has Broken', 'El Condor Pasa', 'Sloop John B' - to name but three. An added bonus here is that young people are presented with the opportunity of realising that many composers\/singers sometimes 'borrow' ideas from others!For the player of a year or more experience there are beautiful Standards like 'The Swan' by Saint-Saens to challenge and inspire. Pachelbel's 'Canon in D' is given in the key of C and is manageable by the older beginner or the younger one of some experience and is a great opportunity for left-hand arpeggio playing practice. In fact pretty well all of the pieces will provide players of any experience with an insight into the musical tradition of the last few hundred years and will help broaden the musical taste of those perhaps over-exposed to modern commercial music.Almost by way of a hidden bonus the books are 'sprinkled' with several popular Christmas pieces of the last few centuries. These are playable by those in their first year or so of playing and will motivate all learners to master them!

Mr. Golding writes beautifully and poetically of this tragic commentary on humans and our society, making the story of these young boys all the more poignant and thought-provoking.This book is not for the weak of mind, nor the faint of heart. Several high school peers of mine found it \"boring and stupid,\" simply because they felt there was not enough adventurous action and \"too many big words.\" They did not understand that Golding wrote as many of the time did, with detailed description of the small things, so as to give the reader a better vision of events and enthrall them further with the story. Truly, this may be his greatest strength: his ability to completely captivate the reader by way of giving descriptions so thorough our mind cannot blur it.Many of my peers also would've liked \"more blood and guts.\" It's a shame they did not realize that Golding did not write of gruesome things to revel in the macabre. He wrote of these to make stick in our hearts the tragedy that young boys, devoid of civilized society, had no ability to stop themselves from committing atrocities. For one to read this book looking to enjoy an unremarkable fairy tale, where things end as happily as they begin, I'm afraid one would be sorely disappointed.I, however, was not disappointed in the least. I expected great things from this story and I received them: an enthralling plot, sincere characters, vivid descriptions, beautifully tragic writing, a deeply affecting social commentary and an ending that keeps you on the edge of your seat.If anyone is bored with a simple movie, I'd suggest buying a copy of William Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES. This is one adventure that will never disappoint!","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \"invisible hand\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \"invisible hand\" which means \"self-corrective markets\", \"liberalism\", \"Laissez-faire\" and \"state non-intervention\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \"invisible hand\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \"invisible hand\" is used: \"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \"invisible hand\" or \"Laissez-faire\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Hard for me to rank a book with 5 stars unless it scares me.This book didn't scare me in terms of content, but it still shook me to the core.I guess I should be more open to a lot of people and encourage the people that wouldn't read a book otherwise, part of what I think Robert Stone does well... he makes you want to read the book, and he makes it as important as today is.

As Tucker documents through a prodigious amount of research, Jane Austen had bigger horizons than some earlier biographers were prepared to conclude.Tucker came to this biography after a previous study of Jane Austen's extended family. In the present volume, Tucker demonstrates how her family connections gave her plausible access to many of the political, military, social, and cultural events of her age. As her surviving letters demonstrate, Jane Austen was a keen and witty observer of the life around her, and made abundant use of her observations in the composition of her novels.Tucker provides a topical rather than chronological approach to Austen's life, with consideration of her various homes, her family members, her romances, her readings, her travels, and her contacts with scandals, religion, and the events of her day. Through his exploration of these topics, Tucker convincingly portrays a woman whose family, friends, and reading habits provided her with much wider horizons than her limited formal education and status as the unmarried youngest daughter of a country cleric might have indicated.\"Jane Austen The Woman\" contains some interesting insights. For example, Tucker's discussion of why Jane Austen never married includes some very pertinent observations about her lack of a dowery, her fears of the consequences of multiple pregnancies, and the example of her spinster sister Cassandra. Oddly, Tucker seems to have overlooked an obvious reason, that Jane Austen wanted to marry for love.Tucker writes in the style of the experienced journalist that he is. He marshals facts and proceeds to connect the dots. He is however subject to the same limitations of information as other Austen biographers; his willingness to proceed bravely into speculation and assumption will be a mixed blessing for the reader.\"Jane Austen The Woman\" is highly recommended to serious students of the life of Jane Austen. Those looking for a more conventional biography may find this book to be a challenging reading experience.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"While I appreciate the remarks about this book's apparently juvenile simplicity, I have to disagree about the book's apparent worthlessness.

It was one of the first \"chapter\" books I ever read and I felt the print version was immensely superior to the Disney version. Perhaps because of the Disney animated feature, I quickly abandoned it as \"childish\" and went on to more \"serious\" literature.I re-read this because it was available for free on Kindle. Once I picked it up I became lost in this timeless meandering tale of Mole, Ratty, Badger and the puffed-up, conceited Mr. Toad. It may be that half a century of living has given me new depth in which to assess these characters.If one has experienced true friendship, one knows the essence of Mole and Rat and how they look out for one another. Rat straps on pistols to go into the Wild Wood after Mole goes missing there. Mole stops Rat from plunging after the mysterious stranger with tales of the sea and gently diverts his mind to poetry and the simple pleasures of country life.Toad, of course, is entertaining, conceited and insufferable -- the fun guy everyone wanted to party with in college but whose friends continually had to get him out of scrapes in later years.Badger's the stalwart person everyone turns to in times of trouble, gruff, blunt-spoken -- the salt of the earth.WIND IN THE WILLOWS reminds us to live in the moment and to cherish our friends, even if they are of different species and different opinions. It rejoices in the pleasures of home and the beauty of nature. It is funny without being cruel and deep without being heavy. I have a shelf of books that list techniques for achieving inner peace which are less effective than just sitting down to read this simple story.

Three years later, I tried it again... and I kicked myself for not having tried it sooner.I think my vision of reading Jane Austen always has me curled up in a chair while it's snowing outside, but in truth, the real memory of reading this book was sitting in the waiting room of a car mechanic while my car was being worked on. That day stands out because as usual, the mechanics only had the usual things to read: &quot;Guns and Ammo&quot; and &quot;Field and Stream&quot;. Add the requisite gumball machine in the corner with stale gumballs and you have the idea. I brought the book with me to read, but didn't really think I would get all that much reading of it done.

All of Austen's works are simple romances, but this one is another unique part of her writing. In most of her novels, Austen had a young heroine, who is blocked from the hero by rivals. In Persuasion, the heroine is Anne Elliot, who is 27 and cannot marry the hero, Captain Wentworth, because of a previous aborted romance. Their history blocks them, but they still manage to overcome it.Austen again manages to create believable characters with sharp wit. However, while good, this book in my opinion isn't in the same great class as Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park or Emma. For me its partially because of its Autumnal air and its rather tiresomely familiar at times. Anne's father, Sir Walter Elliot's character is vanity from beginning to end. Why Austen chose to always have a negative father caricature is a mystery to me. The theme of the navy versus the nobility is also very prevalent. Other lesser characters, such as the Admiral and his wife, Lady Russell, William Elliot and Mrs. Smith are truly alive. So despite my misgivings, Austen sharpened her art enough for a book that makes a great read. It is a read that people will continue to experience for years to come.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"An excellent read and justifiably a classic.

Similarly, beginning in 1895, James delivered a series of lectures to college students -- generally at schools for women -- on education and its purposes. In 1899, James gathered both sets of lectures together and published them as \"Talks to Teachers on Psychology and to Students on Some of Life's Ideals.\" The book was read widely and became financially successful for James.In his illuminating recent biography of James, \"William James in the Maelstrom of American Modernism\", Robert Richardson describes the \"Talks\" as a whole as \"written in what we may call William James's third style.\" He explains: \"The third style is his plainest, clearest, most public style. It is at once vivid, personal, comprehensible, and without a shred of condescension. It is best exemplified in 'Talks to Teachers'. The longer James worked over a subject, the simpler and shorter and more direct he made it\". (p. 360)The two sets of lectures are complementary with the first set explaining to teachers how psychology could be of use in the educational process while the second set explains to the students the value of the educational opportunities presented to them. The \"Talks to Teachers\" begins with what many people at the time saw as a mechanistic psychology rooted in physiology and developed in light of Darwin's theory of evolution. In many places, James encourages teachers to see a pupil in part as \"a subtle little piece of of machinery.\" An effective means of education endeavors to work with rather than against the nervous system. In successive short chapters, James discusses his fundamental theory of the \"stream of consciousness\" and applies it to learned behavior through exploration of reactions, habits, association, attention and memory. The lectures are lucid and clear and show both flexibility and wisdom in considering the process of education.James's focus throughout is on education as an activity fitting the student for the conduct of life in a wide variety of situations rather than as means of learning intellectual abstractions. James stresses the importance of the body and of physical activity in the learning process. His psychology begins with science and mechanism but it does not end there. I would like to point out two of what I found to be among the insightful observations of the \"Talks to Teachers.\" First, in the chapter on \"Memory\", James points out that the psychological abilities of the mind must be taken together in an individual and that a person need not be \"cast down\" by deficiencies in any single element. James stresses passion and desire as critical in overcoming any mechanical difficulties. He writes: \"You can be an artist without visual images, a reader without eyes, a mass of erudition with a bad elementary memory. In almost any subject your passion for the subject will save you. If you only care enough for a result you will almost certainly attain it.\"The other passage in the \"Talks to Teachers\" I wish to single out is in the concluding chapter on \"The Will\". Here James allows Spinoza to have the last word. James points out that there are two ways in which people can make choices: by saying \"no\" to something or by saying \"yes\" to its contrary. James opts for the latter approach. James writes: \"Spinoza long ago wrote in his Ethics that anything that a man can avoid under the notion that it is bad he may also avoid under the notion that something else is good. He who habitually acts sub specie mali, under the negative notion, the notion of the bad, is called a slave by Spinoza. To him who acts habitually under the notion of good he gives the name of freeman. See to it now, I beg you, that you make freement of your pupils by habituating them to act, whenever possible, under the notion of a good\". This is wise advice, from both Spinoza and William James.The second part of the book consists of three wonderful addresses to students: \"The Gospel of Relaxation\", the seminal essay \"On a Certain Blindness in Human Beings\" and its companion essay \"What Makes a Life Significant.\" The first essay is a still timely corrective to the tendency of many Americans to stress and to wrongly-directed effort. But second and third of these essays are critical to James's work in its entirety. The \"blindness\" to which James refers is the difficulty every person has in knowing the mind of another and in properly and sympathetically valuing what the other person finds important and significant in life. As James states in his Preface to \"Talks to Teachers\": \"The facts and worths of life need many cognizers to take them in. There is no point of view absolutely public and universal.\" James develops this theme through the use of literary examples drawn from Robert Louis Stevenson, Whitman, Tolstoy, and many other writers.In the Preface to the \"Talks to Teachers and Students\" James also underscores the importance of the essay \"On a Certain Blindness\". This essay is James's most direct statement of the value of pluralism, individualism, and democracy. He writes: \"The practical consequence of such a philosophy is the well-known democratic respect for the sacredness of individuality -- is, at any rate, the outward tolerance of whatever is not itself intolerant. ... Religiously and philosophically, our ancient national doctrine of live and let live may prove to have a far deeper meaning than our people now seem to imagine it it to possess.\"This short and beautifully written collection of essays is an excellent non-technical introduction to the thought of William James.Robin Friedman","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I would probably scream and faint.Regardless, one makes do with what one has readily available.I found the story thought provoking on many levels. In particular, my first thought upon opening the book was as noted above. I fancied myself the sovereign of knowledge, a throne which holds much promise and much responsibility as Twain demonstrates throughout the book. This mental exercise led me to the same conclusion and results as Hank.I perhaps disdain the collusion and alliance of the church and monarchs as much as Twain who is particularly acrimonious of these institutions. I therefore identified with Hank readily and enjoyed reading as he organized and recruited among the populace those who would be most loyal to his cause. Gradually with education, toil, leadership and a bit of luck he finds himself at the helm of new political and economic system buttressed by a technological revolution.A lesson here perhaps for our \"modern\" leaders?A great bedtime story for your children as well as a disguised critique on monarchy and theocracy.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I can understand why Greg Egan isn't more popular among the general public. As anyone who has looked at his website would know, he is unapologetic about his desire to concentrate on the science part of science fiction. There is no dumbing down with him- if science fiction is literature about ideas rather than people, then he is the genre's most representative writer. And yet, at the same time, I think the degree to which he is often stereotyped as a hard sci-fi writer is exaggerated. If Egan is consistent in his exploration of scientific ideas, he is equally consistent in considering how those scientific developments will impact humanity. Too often science fiction often presents us with worlds where the technology has changed but people haven't- in other words, the future is just like the present, but with more gadgets. Egan is at the forefront of a group of cutting-edge sf writers to tell us no, we are going to change as much as the technology. We may change so much, in fact, that we will be as unrecognizable to our future selves as we are to pond scum.The chief conceit of Permutation City- humans leaving their bodies behind by uploading their consciousnesses into machines- isn't new to sci-fi, but Egan's exploration of the concept is simply the most realistic, provocative and well thought-out one I am aware of. From his prediction that uploading will first develop as a medical tool, to his examination of the role economics play in the virtual lives of the uploaded Copies, to the ultimate existential questions of identity and reality they face, there is no author who has pushed the envelope this far when it comes to virtual reality, mind uploading, and the Singularity. Given the fact we are actually on the verge of creating the technology Egan describes (the Blue Brain project in Switzerland is already modeling animal brains in virtual space), the questions raised by Permutation City will only loom larger in the public consciousness in the years ahead.That being said, this is not a perfect book. Given the immense stretches of time and metaphysical space the novel covers, it's not surprising that the plot is a little creaky and disjointed. Again, this is a function of the fact Egan is more interested in exploring his ideas to the fullest extent possible than constructing a clear A to B to C narrative. The novel also showcases Egan's chief weakness as an author- characterization. Oddly enough, Permutation City features some of Egan's best and worse characters. The protagonist Maria has about as much substance as the Pretty Female Scientist who accompanies James Bond on some of his more recent adventures. Paul Durham is more intriguing, if only for his obsession with Dust Theory, but by far the most haunting character in the book (and all of Egan's work) is the German banker Thomas, who sentences himself to virtual Hell in order to punish himself for having murdered a girl in his youth. Although Egan no doubt believes in the inevitability and perhaps even the necessity of the Singularity, this character reminds us that many will simply use the technology to find new and inventive ways to torture themselves and others.After all, there is always the possibility that the future won't change human nature as much as we may like to believe.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This dictionary is an absolute must for anyone learning Gemara or any other Aramaic works.

These were originally meant to be read at the rate of one a week, but of course you can increase your speed on this compilation. However, I read them in a handful of sittings and suffered from severe overload. First of all, at this fast rate you get a good deal of duplication that waters down the overall affect Thompson was trying to create in his weekly column. Thompson reminds me of the famous Groucho Marx line: \"Whatever it is, he's against it!\" Just picked at random: \"Any baboon with a healthy heart and good diction... could do Neil Frank's job (director of the National Hurricane Center). President Reagan: \"...seems to be dumber than three mules.\" Frank Sinatra: \"...is said to be smart, but he was fired and cut off from every casino in New Jersey when he tried to play blackjack by rules he learned in Nevada...They chased him out like a wino.

In this autobiographical book, Buzzy unselfconsciously reveals how he came to be a big trader in the markets.I loved the book and liked the author, appreciating his honesty. In my view, the best insights Buzzy provided had to do with the relationship between gambling and participating in the markets. It seemed that he was more willing to see what others deny, that stock, options and futures speculating has an inherent gambling component. Rather than downplay this gambling dimension, Buzzy embraced it.Pit Bull also revealed the difficult life of a market trader. My impression was that this field would give most of us health problems due to the constant stress and worry. Schwartz didn't escape this fate.

She is surprised at how easy it is to say and how easy it is to sell her house with her husband and move into their Cape Cod cottage by herself in September, when most people are leaving for the winter. Joan spends a year by the sea, just as the title suggests, mostly thinking and rediscovering herself. Most of the time she is completely alone, left to figure everything out, though she does meet some interesting people along the way.What I was expecting was not necessarily what I got. I saw a lot of myself in Joan and she made me think a lot about the way I see myself. I'm not sure I can articulate what usually bothers me about stories where one person leaves a marriage, but I think it is incredibly difficult for a young person to stand on the other side of making the commitment of marriage with someone to understand what that would be like. What an entire life with someone is like. I think it's also terrifying to sit and think, they were once like me, in love and eager to begin life together, and now they have ended up like this. Is that my fate, too? I like to think it isn't, so I don't necessarily like to read novels and nonfiction that tell me otherwise.But A Year By the Sea was different. Joan explained her situation and reflected on her life in such a way that it was all very clear. Joan, for all the self-discovering she did throughout the book, seems to understand herself better than most. At some point she meets a woman in her 90s, also named Joan, who eventually becomes a sort of mentor to the author. I felt much the same way about the Joan who wrote this book. She was talking directly to me, explaining that sometimes you need to spend some time to figure yourself out and the only mistake you can really make is thinking you're always a complete, finished person. You're not; we are constantly shifting to understand ourselves better and to make ourselves better people.This is a book that I can see myself buying and rereading when I need a little reminder to take life slowly and as it comes, to focus on myself once in a while and to not lose sight that I am a constantly changing person and that is okay. When I looked this book up, I learned that there are three follow up books, something I was very excited to see. One chronicles the next year, when Joan and her husband move back in together to work on their marriage. The second turns A Year By the Sea into a self-help kind of book, that I'm not exactly sure I'm interested in reading. But, I'm especially interested in A Walk By the Sea, a book that focuses completely on Joan Erikson, the older woman Joan met on one of her walks through Cape Cod.Maybe I'm not exactly the target audience for this book (22 year old female), but something about it spoke to me completely. Were there times when Joan was frustrating and even a little selfish? Yes. Were there moments when I didn't understand her motivations and I sympathized with her husband? Absolutely. But Joan puts everything out there. She is unsure of everything she is doing, but she is prepared to find out if it's the right thing.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"As a survivor of abuse as a very young child, it was very difficult for me to connect my own destructive, compulsive behavior to abuse.

Topics from eating disorders to alcohol and drugs are covered, and I'm starting to \"get it\" that all escape behaviors can be tied to childhood abuse, neglect, or shame of some kind.The three-star rating would have been more if the content were not so triggering, and because my own recovery draws more from authors such as Patrick Carnes and John Bradshaw.

Coville doesn't cut corners when it comes to the dark side of the story -- he doesn't linger on the more morbid dialogue, but makes it clear when someone is murdered or poisoned, etc. When seen in such a condensed form, the story is rather dark; the romantic allure of the two teens gets a little lost in the bustle, but this is still a fine adaptation, as are Coville's other works.

He is best known as skeptic and debunker, usually in reviews for NY Review of Books, and in columns in various magazines, most notably Scientific American. Like Stephen Jay Gould, he has a tremendous intellectual range and can make anything interesting, including topics that you believe you could not possibly care about prior to reading Gardner on the subject.All of Gardner's compilations are worth reading and may represent a better introduction to Gardner's thought than the present volume. Nevertheless, this book has a charm that cannot be denied. The book is unlike anything else I have ever read. It is basically a series of musings about various philosophical issues: free will, evil, economics, politics and the nature of god. Gardner begins by giving a simple, understandable summary of the area, including the arguments of the great thinkers on the subject. Gardner then moves to a thorough analysis of the weight of the arguments, and concludes with his own position on the issue.In general reading this book has the feel of being included in the private musings of a great intellect. Gardner is careful to develop his arguments thoroughly and simply so that the neophyte philosopher will not be left behind. (Though in fairness, some terms are not defined, an a Dictionary of Philosophy would be useful in getting the casual reader up to speed.)Gardner's style is charming. He takes up a topic such as determinism versus free will and examines the philosophical arguments that have been raised against the existence of free will. Having admitted the power of the arguments arrayed against free will, Gardner confesses that he believes in free will anyway. And so it goes for arguments against the existence of God, immortality, prayer, etc., in every case confessing that the rational arguments favor positions contrary to his own, and then maintaining them anyway.Gardner is a \"fideist,\" meaning that he acknowledges the impossibility of demonstrating rationally the existence of God and related issues, but insisting that faith is an appropriate mechanism for getting around these difficulties. Gardner is never heavy-handed or preachy in his positions, and he gives the arguments against him a fair hearing.The joy of reading this book is that the issues are so clearly presented that the reader can assess his own thoughts on the subject. I personally do not buy fideism as a justification for abandoning reason, but the book presented the alternative views so well that I felt comfortable disagreeing with Gardner in his conclusion.In the end, fideism is an interesting point of view. It does not require the destruction of arguments against one's belief in God. In fact, the fideist can revel in the irrationality of his position. While the reader may not be convinced to believe as Gardner does, I will bet you will come away with a better grasp of the issues involved.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"The book is fine, but I wouldn't advise getting the CD-ROM.

Malcolm has an extraordinary intelligence and imagination--both expressed in her metaphors, many of them extended beyond belief. I particularly liked her metaphors for and about Olwyn Hughes, Ted Hughes's sister: \"Cerberus to the Plath estate,\" Anne Stevenson's unsuccessful commanding of \"Olwyn back into the lamp,\" Anne's obliviously walking into \"Olwyn's web.\" (Anne wrote what Malcolm says is a good biography of Plath that Olwyn insisted on editing and correcting as the price of permission to quote.) Malcolm has brilliant things to say about memory and memoirs, criticism, biography, the impossibility of fair-mindedness and truth, writing in general, the language of face and body that can't be captured on recordings, and footnotes. What I don't understand, although Malcolm addresses the question, is why any of the people she interviewed and wrote about gave her permission to quote them. Even the people whose sides she takes emerge scarred and bleeding from her descriptions. Surely her reputation for this proclivity preceded her with at least some of the characters in the book. On the other hand, the noted critic Harold Bloom has remarked on her \"wonderful exuberance\" and has stated that her books \"transcend what they appear to be: superb reportage.\"Of biography Malcolm says that it \"is the medium through which the remaining secrets of the famous dead are taken from them and dumped out into full view of the world. The biographer at work, indeed, is like the professional burglar, breaking into a house . . . . The voyeurism and busybodyism that impel writers and readers of biography alike are obscured by an apparatus of scholarship designed to give the enterprise an appearance of banklike blandness and solidity.\" And, \"there is no length he [the biographer] will not go to, and the more his book reflects his industry the more the reader believes that he is having an elevating literary experience, rather than simply listening to backstairs gossip and reading other people's mail.\" Similarly, \"The reader's amazing tolerance (which he would extend to no novel written half as badly as most biographies) makes sense only when seen as a kind of collusion between him and the biographer in an excitingly forbidden undertaking: tiptoeing down the corridor together to stand in front of the bedroom door and try to peep through the keyhole.\"She uses one of her extended metaphors to discuss the issues of writer's block and the elusiveness of truth, which I had not realized were related: \"At the end of Borges's story 'The Aleph,' the narrator goes to the cellar of a house, where he has the experience of encountering everything in the world. He at once sees all places from all angles . . . . Writer's block derives from the mad ambition to enter the cellar; the fluent writer is content to stay in the close attic of partial expression, to say what is 'running through his mind,' and to accept that it may not--cannot--be wholly true.\" Later, Malcolm says, \"Truth is, in its nature, multiple and contradictory, part of the flux of history, untrappable in language.\" She contrasts nonfiction and fiction in an interesting way: \"In a work of nonfiction we almost never know the truth of what happened. The ideal of unmediated reporting is regularly achieved only in fiction, where the writer faithfully reports what is going on in his imagination.\" (Of course that leaves unanswered the real question of whether that imagination captures the truth.) Finally, Malcolm relates a visit she made to the incredibly littered, filthy house of an artist and author who had written recollections about Plath. She saw the place as \"a kind of monstrous allegory of truth\" in its \"unmediated actuality, in all its multiplicity, randomness, inconsistency, redundancy, authenticity.\"In relation to the cluttered house, she writes further, \"the narratives called biographies pale and shrink in the face of the disorderly actuality that is life. . . . Each person who sits down to write faces not a blank page but his own vastly overfilled mind. The problem is to clear out most of what is in it, . . . to make a space where a few ideas and images and feelings may be so arranged that a reader will want to linger awhile among them, rather than to flee. . . . But this task of housecleaning (of narrating) is not merely arduous; it is dangerous. There is the danger of throwing the wrong things out and keeping the wrong things in.\"Malcolm is also insightful on post-structuralism, a viewpoint that she at least partly shares, calling it \"a theory of criticism whose highest values are uncertainty, anxiety, and ambiguity.\" Writing about a poststructuralist writer and professor of English literature who wrote _The Haunting of Sylvia Plath_, Malcolm says that \"In accordance with post-structuralist theory,\" Jacqueline \"Rose argues for suspension of all certainty about what happened, and thus of judgment and blame.\" Finally, she refers to \"the post-structuralist vision of writing as a kind of dream, which no one (including the dreamer-writer) ever gets to the bottom of.\"Of her conversation with Rose, Malcolm says, \"I render it with the help of a tape recording, which preserved the words that passed between Rose and me but did not catch any of the language of face and body by which we all speak to one another and sometimes say what we dare not put into words.\" This from a woman who had won a lawsuit brought against one of her books about Freudianism by a psychoanalyst; she won by playing a tape recording of her interview with him.Recommended even for people who are not specifically interested in Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes because of the book's insights into the nature of truth, memoirs,fiction, and biography.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Karana is an Indian girl who lives with her tribe on the Island of the Blue Dolphins. One day, a ship comes to take the Indians to a larger, more populated island. When Karana realizes that her younger brother is still on the island she jumps out of the ship to be with him, but later when he is killed by the pack of wild dogs that wander the island, she is alone to survive on its isolated beauty. She wants revenge on the wild dogs for killing Ramo, her brother, but falls in love with the pack leader.At first Karana is truly sad for the loss of her brother, but soon makes friends with other animals on and around the island. Karana named the dog she once wanted dead Rontu, and best friends were made. He went wherever he was allowed to with her. Karana is alone for 18 years on this beautiful isolated island, and hopes to get off it. Karana also hopes that the `Aleut' (white) people will come and rescue her from the lonesome place.The genre of this book is adventure. Even though this book does not have a sequel, Island of the Blue Dolphins will teach you to never give up, just like the main character. There are many possible themes, such as: Man vs. Nature; Survival; Courage; and Friendship. I believe Scott O'Dell's book will inspire many 10+, or anyone else who loves a good book. Scott O'Dell does have some beautiful pictures in this spectacular book, but you won't need them for the movie in your head. This book is based on `La Isla de San Nicolas', and Karana is based on the girl Robinson Crusoe whose life Scott O'Dell has attempted to recreate. This is a wonderful story. Everyone should take the time to read this Newbery Medal Winner.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I was a student of Bob Papper's at Ball State University and was among the first classes to use this book.

This means that the central premise for much of the sex in Kushiel's Dart isn't going to connect with me. Fortunately, there's more to this novel than just sadomasochism, though that seems to be what a lot of people want to dwell on when they talk about it. It's also got a lot of complex political maneuvering, and some good characters. I particularly liked old Delaunay, even though he has some really twisted morals; maybe that's what made him so interesting.The writing is good, in sharp contrast to the other and earlier famous fantasy series about sadomasochism, theGorseries. But ultimately, the end of Kushiel's Dart just takes too long to happen. For all practical purposes, the story is over after the battle at Troyes-Le-Mont, but it just keeps going and going after this. I suspect this is because fantasy novels today are expected to be super-long, and because Carey wanted to set up her sequels. Unfortunately, it undermines this book, and when I looked at the sequels, I wasn't impressed, so I have to say the effort wasn't worthwhile.","sentiment_score":0.6},{"review":"One day, having been smitten with Provence, France for a long time, I discovered the Travel Literature section of my local bookstore.

The author was able to take a portion of John Dee's diaries and not only modernize the wording and name of places but also translate some of the Greek and Latin passages. Hence it creates a down to earth but yet scholarly edition of John Dee's Diaries. What really impressed me about this book were the references at the end of the chapters. Not only does Fenton list numerous sources where to gather more information but also goes a bit more in detail about what is going on in the life of Dr. John Dee. At the end of the book there is a \"biographical guide.\" This part of the book is not only interesting but also invaluable. It lists all the major characters that were involved in John Dee's diaries and shows when they were born, died, and gives a brief description of the person. The only thing that kept me from giving this book five stars was the author's attitude towards Edward Kelly. Edward Fenton often portrays Kelly as a trickster (which he may very well have been) but seems to add his opinion at the wrong times when there appears to be no real evidence suggesting his opinion. Other than that one minor flaw I recommend this book to the student, teacher, casual reader, philosopher, & even to the mage.

Aside from the value of his researches and his introduction of novel and productive sociological methods into the writing of Roman History, he was a master of English prose. His love of Tacitus no doubt encouraged his writing of well-balanced periodic sentences, the 20th Century equivalent of those of Gibbon and Samuel Johnson.Most of Sir Ronald's books are now out of print. Therefore it is all the more disgraceful that his longtime publisher, Oxford University Press should charge $137.00 for the paperback edition of one of the few of his books to remain in print. Theusual excuses for such price inflation are that the book has only limited appeal and the academic publisher must offset the expense. of publication by gouging the few readers expected to buy the book, and that the high cost of the book to the reader allows the press to offset the cost of publishing other similar commercially unviable but academically valuable titles. These arguments would be legitimate (however distasteful the result for the reader who may find it necessary to buy the book) if this book were published by, e.g, Southern Illinois University Press, but this is the OUP, for God's sake, whose popular editions of classics can be found on the shelves of every Barnes and Nobles and Borders throughout the world.

The fictional Reece interviews Ava Gardner, Lana Turner, Jean Peters, and other Hughes contacts, filling the novel with detail as he personalizes the reclusive Hughes. All the interviews, notes from Hughes's &quot;diary,&quot; quotations by Richard Nixon, memos by an FBI field agent, transcripts of tape recordings, and comments by Hughes's former employees are imaginative and often hilarious creations of the author, not real at all. Although some readers may question the propriety of basing the entire &quot;biography&quot; on invented quotations purportedly made by real people, the book is clearly label as fiction, and the basic information about Hughes's life is largely factual.Modesty, self-effacement, and humility are not biographer Reece's strong suits, as we note from the opening pages. His first book, Melville and the Whale, was successful, and, he tells us, he secured a seven figure advance for the Hughes biography. His assistants do the &quot;tedious aspects of research,&quot; he doesn't get along with people at the Hughes Archives, and he accepts money from Fox TV, though, ultimately, things don't &quot;work out.&quot; He likens his experience with the prestigious MacArthur Foundation to &quot;dealing with a seventeenth-century French king handing out Christmas Lagniappes.&quot; As Reece recreates the downward spiral of Hughes's life, from the Hollywood days, through his confrontations with Bugsy Siegel, and to his use of a double to confuse the U.S. Government, the reader notes a parallel deterioration in Reece's own life.For anyone intrigued with the Howard Hughes story, this novel provides some unique, albeit fictional, glimpses into what might have been Hughes's thinking and into events which might have shaped his decisions. Humor, much of it slapstick, keeps the reader grounded in (fictional) reality, however much Hughes and Reece might be losing their touch, and as the novel comes to a wonderfully ironic close and author Steven Carter has the last laugh, even the most jaded reader will laugh along with him.

Trenton, Saratoga, and Yorktown have received much more publicity, which is fine; but in this novel Kenneth Roberts has tilled fallow round and raised a bountiful harvest.The story is narrated by Steven Nason, a Maine resident with a fervent attachment to his home in Arundel. His tale begins innocently, set amidst the daily issues of the northern frontier- the French, the native Americans, and the tempestuous British colonists as they strive to hold ground in early America. Only gradually are Steven, his family, and his Indian friends drawn into the contest of nations that will in time lead to the formation of the United States.The assault on Quebec really happened, and the story is full of brilliant cameos, including a fierce Daniel Morgan, a jaunty young Aaron Burr, and a still-untried George Washington. But the real historical hero of Arundel is Benedict Arnold, seen before his infamous betrayal of the continential cause. Here he is energetic and charismatic as he leads the first foray against the British in the New World. Steven's vision of Arnold is more generous than history usually gives that founding father, without reverting to blind hero worship- indeed, a few incidents hint at Arnold's eventual frustration with the incontinent buerocracy of his fellow leaders and his prickly sense of honor. But this future struggle fades as Steven describes the difficulties of the expedition across the wilderness of Maine, and the trial of the seige of Quebec. Roberts has done some fantastic research, so that the landscape and people that Arnold and Nason travel amidst vibrates with vivid depictions of the Height of Land, the French inhabitants of early Canada, and the rugged and beautiful Maine coastline.Best of all, Roberts has brilliant prose, so rarely discovered today; Steven's narrative unfolds like a fireside tale on a cold winter night in Maine, calling to mind all the struggles and zeal of those early patriots who forsook home an hearth to seek a free nation. Through it all runs the shining thread of Steven's lost love, Mary, and his fast friends Cap Huff and Phoebe Marvin, who accompany Steven on his adventures. The fictional characters are vivid and lifelike, breathing color and feeling into the already thrilling journey. If you have any interest in how a wrinkle in history can become a terrific novel, this is your book.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I am in my sixties and had never read Moby Dick.

Many of phrases from Hamlet now challenge Bible for those popular quotes that no one remembers where they came from. The real fun is in just reading the story and as you find that it is not as foreign as you may have thought; you see many characters like these around you today.A synopsis, Old Hamlet conquered Old Fortinbras seizing Fortinbras' land. Now that Old Hamlet is dead, Young Fortinbras wants his land back and is willing to take it by force. Meanwhile back in D&auml;nemark Prince Hamlet who is excessively grieving the loss of his father, the king, gets an interesting insight from his father's ghost. Looks like Old Hamlet was a victim of a \"murder most foul\"; it appears his mother and uncle were in cahoots on the murder.

I even prevailed upon my own book club to read it, to mixed reviews.I find this book is one you think about long after you've finished reading it. No, it is not by any means a plot-driven book, although I take exception to those who say there is no plot. There is one -- each character has a conflict, and in his\/her own way, resolves the conflict. The tragedy of the misfit in a callous society is mirrored in each of the characters' lives. Each is searching for a connection, and the times they live in and the town they live in prevent most of them from making that connection. I don't think this is as unusual as some readers seem to think. There are many people in our society today who don't fit in, and their loneliness is profound and isolating.Read the book for it's exquisite prose -- prose that is still very understandable, by the way -- for it's extraordinary character development, and for those who study the craft of writing, McCuller's ability to weave 5 characters' points of view effectively in one novel is breathtaking.But, as I said, if you've never been lonely, and you aren't introspective in the least, don't bother reading it.

Being the cooky baker in the family, I remember the countless hours I spent browsing through all the wonderful pages, literally reading our Cooky Book from cover to cover. Through the years mom would loan out her book when it was cooky baking time and some time ago it ended up lost in action. We couldn't find a reprint copy to replace it. It was a family treasure we truly missed. Sure, I had some of my favorite recipes written down and filed away, but I really missed the holiday ritual of browsing through all the beautiful color pages of cookies. This year my sister presented me an early Christmas gift of my very own copy of The Cooky Book. I immediately began browsing its' pages, sharing old cooky baking stories with my daughters. Everytime I see its' cover staring at me from my kitchen shelf, I feel a bit nostalgic as I recall the happy moments throughout my childhood when I discovered yet another favorite cooky recipe. It was the best gift my sister could ever have given me. Now that a copy of The Cooky Book is back within the family ...in my possession... I have been designated the official cooky baker. I have my work cut out for me, but I enjoy the warm fuzzy feeling I impart on my family members when I present them with a gift of their favorite holiday cookies from The Cooky Book.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This did not help me study.

The themes and ideas are to show the \"normal\" human person who finds themselves in deeply emotional events...but they do not show the appropriate emotions at the appropriate period of time. Is this normal? We have seen people overreact and act overly emotionally to deaths or other situations for base reasons. Does that make them normal? We often know people are faking their reactions at funerals and playing a role. This is normal. The precips of The Stranger tell us that acting a role does not make the emotion real. The protagonist does not bother to act the role that society assigns him and he is JUDGED! This is the crux of this novel. I love this novel because it makes me examine humans as individual creatures...we cannot be encapsulated by one defining theme or idea. Humans are much too confusing and evolving to capture in one defining moment forever. They will be, as in Camus's novel, judged, but it reflects life...and life changes.

I truly believe this is one of the most beautiful books ever written. Smith is so observant of life. Although Francie is the main character, I love how she gets into the minds of some of the other characters. For example, the scene where she retells how Johnny and Katie met, and how Katie was willing to give up everything to look at him and love him for the rest of her life. Aunt Sissy is one of my all time favorite characters. I love how multi-faceted she is. How she is so good and \"bad\" at the same time. However, of course, I love Francie, and her amazing observations of life: how she loves how Jewish women are proud when they are pregnant, how she wants to read every book in the library, and how excited she is to go to school. Another reader mentioned how this book is like an old friend, and I can't agree more. I open it and reread passages in dark times.

It is full of lovingly written vignettes, worldly experiences, spiritual beauty, salty character, and really tasty recipes from her travel adventures so you can live vicariously, gastronomically, alongside her. Her greatest plotline is to seize the day, day after day, every second of every day. It took me months to finish this book because I didn't want it to end, but during the last few chapters I just couldn't put it down. I'm so grateful to her for sharing these travel stories, these details, these colors and sights and scents of the world.

Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia. During World War II, four siblings are sent from London to a house in the country, where they are drawn into a magical world ruled by an evil witch.Here, Lewis introduces the reader to a charming fantasy world populated with creatures drawn from Norse and Greek mythology. This kind of world will be instantly familiar to fantasy readers of all ages, as Lewis, one of the cornerstones of the modern high fantasy genre, has inspired a great deal of imitation (and, let's be honest, some outright cribbing).Lewis's narration is perfect for the children's genre: it is full of quaint homey details and little assurances to the reader (he also speeds through what would otherwise be graphic or horrific scenes). Additionally, Lewis does a nice job giving all four siblings the broad strokes of distinct personalities in such a short book.While The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is not an allegory in the strict sense of the word, it does contain a great deal of strong and rather unmistakable Christian imagery. The most apparent such imagery centers around Aslan, who is an obvious Christ figure, and whose fate parallels Christ's Passion. Indeed, while Aslan debuts rather late in the book, he dominates the story, which is, at its core, all about what Aslan is doing rather than what the children are doing.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a delightful read and a wonderful initiation to the world of Narnia. Yes, The Magician's Nephew comes first chronologically, but it is here that Lewis makes his introductions.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I could very easily and would be most willing to write a full-length essay simply on the impact this couple has made on my life (and I suspect, millions of others). However, as I realize that is not the purpose here, you can chill out! :0)Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, who in my humble opinion, are the first couple of African-American theater, take the reader on a compelling journey. The book is so profound because not only does it give you a real glimpse into some very important events\/lives\/situations of well-known figures in the civil rights struggle of the African-American but it is told from the perspectives of a black man, a black woman, a married man, a married woman, an aspiring actor\/actress and ultimately from the simple perspective of two human beings in the midst of some very historical moments in American history as well as American entertainment. To be sure, each could easily and quite successfully have penned their memoirs separately but to combine two lives in one book, especially these two lives, was nothing short of remarkable.Their writing style is impeccable so much so that you can easily hear their voices as you read this which is like icing on the cake. We see their struggle to become their own person in the midst of some very tumultuous times. As these two are also quite intellectual and at many times give differing opinions on a variety of topics, i.e. marriage, children, abortion, civil rights, communism, labor practices of the time, etc., the reader gets a sparkling take on such luminaries as Malcolm X, Dr. King, Sydney Poitier, Harry Belafonte, as well as a host of other lesser-known soldiers in the struggle for equality. It is also these very instances and experiences that combined to make Ossie and Ruby the people they are\/were. An added bonus is watching how these events\/people affected their personal lives, i.e. their marriage, their parenting, and the timbre of the relationship they have with their children.Suffice it to say, I am not very objective where these two are concerned. They present a woooooooooonderful book that is an easy read, informative, witty, honest, thoroughly entertaining, as well as poignant, sad, and important. It is such an entertaining narrative, that I purposely avoided finishing it .....just didn't want it to end.. I KNOW I will read it again and probably more than once.I submit this is a very important book and while it specifically speaks of the struggle of African-Americans and the impact that struggle made on them as individuals, this book easily has something to say to anybody.I hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiighly recommend.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I got this book along with the Universal Waite deck. I was interested in the original book that A.E.Waite published along with his now-famous deck of cards.What I find interesting is that Mr. Waite states quite clearly that the Tarot never had any origins in Egypt, nor is it associated with other doctrines such as Astrology, Numerology or Kabbalah. His writing style is, at best, witty and sarcastic. He gives us the meanings of the cards (at face value) and leaves us to figure out the rest.Of course, Tarot has undergone several changes and has had several associations with all the abovementioned doctrines. The meanings have gone through a radical change; and correctly so, since all associations with the cards pictures and archetypes must change over time.All in all, it is a wonderful book for someone who is interested in the roots of Tarot - especially connected to his deck - which forms the basis for anyone who is interested in learning the Tarot.On a more personal note: I like the wit and sarcasm of Mr. Waite.

I went on to like Sex, Lies & Online Dating, Tangled Up In You, thought Simply Irresistible was just passable before buying Truly, Madly Yours. It's the best contemporary romance I have had the pleasure to read. It may not be new but the romance and the way it's told is timeless. I know I could read this ten years from now and would still be moved by it.The relationship between Nick and Delaney got me at every turn, at every stage and I've never wanted an HEA for a couple as much as I wanted it for these two. This book had everything to make it a keeper - the romance was bittersweet at first then slowly bloomed; the sex was hot because of the chemistry between Nick and Del and the supporting cast was fabulous.Something to note - despite the cartoonish cover, there is nothing comedic about this book. It is not even a romantic comedy so I'm surprised at the tags some people have attached to it. On the contrary, it's a somewhat serious and emotional story, full of unrequited love, angst and childhood hurts and passions revisited before the protagonists get their happy ending.If there's another book like this one, I hope someone tells me but right now, this is The One.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I have read all of Steinbeck's books and have taught most of them in my classes.

Up to now, years later, I have only read about three-quarters of the first volume, and I do not expect to complete it anytime soon. It is obviously not that the unabridged version is bad, but that it is meant for a scholarly audience, and thus contains many chapters which are boring for the casual reader, such as a painfully detailed description of the Empire's finances.

Eventually, Hotspur (Henry Percy) and Prince Hal (Henry Monmouth - later Henry V) battle in single combat.We also get to see the contrast between these young men in temperament and character. King Henry wishes his son were more like Hotspur. Prince Hal realizes his own weaknesses and seems to try to assure himself (and us) that when the time comes he will change and all his youthful foolishness will be forgotten. Wouldn't that be a luxury we wish we could all have afforded when we were young?Of course, Prince Hal's guide through the world of the cutpurse and highwayman is the Lord of Misrule, the incomparable Falstaff. His wit and gut are featured in full. When Prince Hal and Poins double-cross Falstaff & company, the follow on scenes are funny, but full of consequence even into the next play.But, you certainly don't need me to tell you anything about Shakespeare. Like millions of other folks, I am in love with the writing. However, as all of us who read Shakespeare know, it isn't a simple issue. Most of us need help in understanding the text. There are many plays on words, many words no longer current in English and, besides, Shakespeare's vocabulary is richer than almost everyone else's who ever lived. There is also the issue of historical context, and the variations of text since the plays were never published in their author's lifetime.For those of us who need that help and want to dig a bit deeper, the Arden editions of Shakespeare are just wonderful.-Before the text of the play we get very readable and helpful essays discussing the sources and themes and other important issues about the play.-In the text of the play we get as authoritative a text as exists with helpful notes about textual variations in other sources. We also get many many footnotes explaining unusual words or word plays or thematic points that would likely not be known by us reading in the 21st century.-After the text we get excerpts from likely source materials used by Shakespeare and more background material to help us enrich our understanding and enjoyment of the play.However, these extras are only available in the individual editions. If you buy the \"Complete Plays\" you get text and notes, but not the before and after material which add so much! Plus, the individual editions are easier to read from and handier to carry around.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Pollan writes in an entertaining and informative manner that kept me turning pages well into the night.

I'm positive that no other director and visionary would have their works commited to such a project other than Kubrick. The final touch is the inclusion of an actual strip of 70mm motion picture film from 2001 that Kubrick himself possessed. My copy shows Frank jogging in the centrifuge.

It is just what the title says, a book doing the job a lawyer does, when he \"sums up\" a case before sending it off to the jury for a verdict. The evidence is examined, witnesses are dissected, and finally the attorney states his view of the case.But Maugham is not summing up a case, he's summing up his life. As he says, there are a number of issues he has been working on for years, and he wants to set them down while he still has time. (As it turned out, he had lots of time!)One of the first, and most interesting discussions, is \"how to write good English prose.\" You would imagine that any author worth his salt has opinions on this, but Maugham offers a veritable graduate seminar. Is an entire lifetime long enough to really master the task? He examines Swift, Dryden, Dr. Johnson, and a myriad of other classic writers, and finally sums up his own goals in writing English. In order, they are clarity (lucidity), simplicity, and euphony. That it to say, Goal One is to express your meaning clearly, and then make sure that it is as simple as possible. Third, make it sound well on the ear.Another long and interesting discussion concerns drama and the theater. You'll learn a lot from this \"master dramatist's\" long reflection and learning. In fact, his plays made his fortune --- he earned enough to return to the writing of fiction (he was actually sick of the theater) and began making a whole new reputation as a master of the short story. Naturally, he provides a long discussion of the various ways to write a story, and finally settles himself firmly in the camp of the ancient storyteller, who held his audience spellbound around a roaring fire.Quite a bit of Maugham's life story does leak into \"The Summing Up.\" Both Maugham and Chekhov are instances of a rather common pattern: doctors who write. This pattern includes a lot of people, most recently Theodore Dalrymple.To sum up :-) ---- this is a fascinating book, one of Maugham's best, and very highly recommended.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Nathan Price, a holy-roller Baptist preacher in the 1950s, drags his wife and four daughters off to the Belgian Congo to preach the gospel to the heathens.

It is fascinating to see the exploration of faith, love, hate, ego, and bigotry as it is played out among the stranded Price women and the increasingly insane Nathan Price.

When it arrived, I sat down to read it and finished in a day or so.The book is about the bombing of Dresden, Germany during WWII. It's not about it in the typical sense that a book is about something: you won't find graphic descriptions of the bombing, you won't read about detailed feelings of those who were there or anything like that. It's more of a...story based AROUND the bombing. You have to read it in order to get what I mean.I do find it to be a great book. It made me think, and actually caused me to do a little research into the bombing itself and form an opinion.I don't necessarily recommend this book to everyone.

The musical follows the same basic storyline and uses the characters, but the musical diverges in some significant ways:1. The book is written as an investigation into Raoul's and Christine's disappearance. Since Raoul and Christine are missing, there is no one person who knows the entire story. Therefore, the investigator pieces together different narratives and different people tell different parts of the story. I found this wonderfully effective. In most books the main character is narrating and so you're pretty sure he\/she is going to make it; but in this case you don't know until the very end what will happen. (I know some reviewers have complained that the narrative jumped around, but this was both intentional and an incredibly creative way to tell the story.)2. The Phantom (Erik) is not the leading character that you see in the musical. In fact, he's hardly in it. I found this very effective too, because he was this lurking shadowy presence through much of the book which led up to a great climax.3. There is no love triangle. Christine is solidly in love with Raoul. I thought this was far superior to the weird love triangle the musical adds. It always bothered me that the musical seems to overlook the fact that the Phantom is a murderer who likes toying with people and then tries to threaten Christine into marrying him by threatening to kill Raoul. The book treats the Phantom with sympathy, but doesn't pretend he's a romantic hero.4. The Phantom is a much darker character. He's not a nice guy. He's sympathetic because of the way he had been treated, but the author doesn't romanticize what he did.5. Raoul is a strong and interesting character. He's the real hero of the story.I disagree with the comments suggesting there isn't a love story. There most certainly IS a love story. It's just not the love story that ALW added, and IMO, the love story between Raoul and Christine works so much better than the relationship with the Phantom that ALW added.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"My husband bought this to share with our seven year old and he had fun following along while his dad turned the pages.I took it to my preschool class and shared it during storytime one day and they loved it.

After Roland frees his siblings from a spell, the man gives them a stone, a spear, a sword, and a cauldron, and they are sent back to their own world to guard these items from evil forces.But problems arise when the kids go home and hide the items: The power that they emanate is so intense that it disrupts electricity and radio signals, causing problems all over their town. They bury the objects -- but that's only a temporary measure. The strange situation grows stranger when armed warriors appear near the buried objects, and an Ouija board displays the name \"Findhorn\" and a picture of a unicorn...One of the wonderful things about Garner's Alderly duology is that when strange people and things were encountered by our heroes, it made our world seem like almost a parallel universe. It made everything seem magic. That quality is somewhat lacking in \"Elidor\"; the opening chapters have a promising glimpse of Elidor, but unfortunately this is never exploited. The evil force is another problem; unlike in the Alderly books, the evil is never given a face or an identity, and so it seems a little difficult to really get upset about.Despite this, the opening and final chapters show Garner's lyrical style, and all of it displays his keen sense of plot development. The descriptions of the electrical disruptions are almost surreal, and his descriptions of Elidor are outstanding. So is his usage of Celtic mythology, though to a lesser extent than his other children's books; the dialogue ranges from chirpy British-schoolchild conversation to the formal language of the Elidor inhabitants. And don't be afraid of the portrayal of the unicorn -- Garner shies away from all the cliches.It's not really a lightweight read, but \"Elidor\" is a beautifully written little tale that will thrill fantasy readers. Quite nice.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"Everyone in my book group loved this book! It's pretty outrageousthat this book has become so hard to get.

There is no faulting O'Brian's ability to craft a richly detailed and captivating tale combined seamlessly with subtle plot twists and turns. The Napoleonic wars and the escape of Napoleon from Elba provide the backdrop to this incredible tale filled with action and political intrigue that completely captives the reader.The personalities of the families, friends, and enemies left ashore by Aubrey and Mautrin permeate their lives at sea. If not considered in this light, the death of Mautrin's wife, Diana, would be a meaningless detail. This is also what allows the reader to become intimate with Aubrey and Mautrin, almost as if they are old friends. O'Brian is never callow or derivative. You should not expect these sea-going tales to be filled with swashbuckling adventure of which the singular point is action.This nineteenth installment takes you across the Mediterranean and the Adriatic, and into combat against the French navy. It also takes you ashore into North Africa to intercept caravans carrying gold. This gold is intended for Muslin mercenaries who are disposed to support Napoleon. This is an outstanding installment to the series and most definitely can stand on its own.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I picked up this book after being interested in trying PC recording for months.

But Lacroix has more invested in his research facility than she can imagine, and as she begins to uncover the truth, she is drawn deeper and deeper into his world. Despite some problems which are probably more matters of personal taste than otherwise (I found just a little more cribbing from other sources than I like, though I recognize it as an occupational hazard for genre writers.) Dunne has constructed a workable universe, and a relatively new take on vampirism - sub-genre: Physiological reasons for their existence. She writes with assurance and the competence mentioned earlier, but without some essential spark which would have kept me wondering what was going to happen next. The writing is good, neither particularly crisp nor particularly sluggish, but eminently readable and fairly undemanding. If there are any glaringly awkward bits, it's probably that she tends to over-use colorful descriptions, such as referring to Desmond's voice as \"caramel.\" The plot itself isn't too strenuous; we're told almost from the beginning what Desmond's game is and the rest of the book pretty much works through his concerns with Rebecca's help. There's a good deal of sex here, as well, and those who don't care for the graphic stuff might be put off, though I found it a nice change from the implied sex of so much vampire lore. But again, there's nothing dazzling about it, nothing visceral, and that's a shame. The characters are pretty much what you'd expect; dark, brooding hero with a secret, spunky, beautiful heroine who is his soul mate, who understands and accepts even in the face of what is commonly thought of as horror. Competent but no sparkle.I wish I could have liked this book more, I wish I could find something more to say than \"competent\" because I sound as if I'm damning with faint praise which really isn't the case at all. Even blunt criticism would probably be better than relative indifference, but I have no major quarrels with what Dunne writes or how she writes it. If she could put some muscle in her prose or make her story quirkier I believe she could produce a book that would capture the imagination. \"Dark Salvation\" is not that book, alas. I would recommend it if you're a die-hard vampire romance fan or a voracious reader of romances looking for something just a little different, but if you want to be dazzled, I don't think this one is for you.","sentiment_score":0.6},{"review":"If you desire to be a powerful man or woman of God, or you simply wish to know Him, this is a must read book.

Herrmann, PhD, MFTAuthor of \"Walt Whitman: Shamanism, Spiritual Democracy, and the World Soul\"I read this book thirty-five years ago and it is still one of my favorites. With the recent publication of Jung's Red Book we can now see where his descent into the archaic psyche began, what its roots were in the various dialogues he conducted with figures of his imagination, and what his breakthrough to the origin of religions revelations might have to contribute to the challenges in our contemporary world situation that is rapidly witnessing a meltdown in monotheistic fundamentalism currently plaguing the globe. C. G. Jung's seven brilliant essays \"Symbols and the Interpretation of Dreams\" written in fluent English and published shortly after his death in 1961, form the last summation of his monumental life work and it is still the best book around on dream analysis for the professional and the layperson alike. I can gladly say that what stands out for me most as a post-Jungian writer and poet is the accent Jung places on language. He writes in such an effortless way, I feel, that it boggles the mind. This may be Jung's masterpiece. I recommend Jung's seven essays to all readers at whatever level they might be in their exploration of the human mind. The other chapters in \"Man and His Symbols\" are all exceptionally well written by his closest followers; all are great teachers of Jung's psychology of individuation, particularly Marie-Louise von Franz, and Joseph L. Henderson.What Jung says in this book is that analysis is an individual endeavor engaged in between patient and analyst, and we must come to this work without any pre-formed theoretical ideas; more importantly, all depth-psychotherapists must be mindful of this: dreams can only be understood when \"we are able to learn the language of the patient\" and \"we must pay particular attention to the language of dreams that are symbolic.\" \"The study of this language,\" Jung adds \"is almost a science in itself\" (227).The language of dreams and their interpretation arises from the patient's \"original nature\" (255) and in order to understand what this is, we would be wise to take clues from \"children\" and so-called \"primitive societies.\" What Jung suggests here is that to interpret dreams correctly, we need to scrutinize the \"archaic remnants\" of the human mind to arrive at \"tap-root.\" By this he means we need to get to know the \"archaic mind\" or \"archaic man\" inside each person, \"whose psyche was still similar to that of an animal\" (228). The \"archaic psyche,\" Jung writes, is what we were as children. We were that mind, but did not know it because we were completely submerged within it. This means we carry the archaic history of humankind from the cradle to mid-life to old age and death.In the seventh Essay there is a footnote, moreover, a reference to Mircea Eliade's masterpiece \"Shamanism.\" Jung points to the indistinguishability here between dream images and emotions. The two, affect and image, exist side by side, he says. It is precisely their \"emotionality,\" Jung asserts that gives dream images such \"critical importance.\" When a dream image is stripped of its emotion, or \"numinosity,\" Jung cautions all we are left with is a \"word picture\" (258). Thus, the task of the depth-psychologist is to stay attuned to the emotions, the feeling-toned rhythms of dream images.Because we have stripped the sacred of its mystery and numinosity, moreover, Jung says that \"nothing is holy any longer\" (254). Jung conjectures that our subjective consciousness has forgotten that \"God speaks chiefly through dreams and visions\" (262) and because the world's religions have not retained much of their \"original numinosity,\" we need to turn to our \"original revelations\" to uncover the truths of our own individual Selfhood. By this Jung means that \"infantile memories\" still contain imprints of \"archetypal modes of psychic functioning\" that are the primary channels or psychic gateways for \"a greater extension of consciousness\" (259).Jung was at pains to point out in the end that people today are \"painfully aware of the fact that neither\" our \"great religions\" nor our \"various philosophies\" can provide us with \"those powerful ideas that would give\" us the \"certainty\" we need \"in face\" of the present world situation (261). \"Change must begin with one single individual\" he says and \"it might be any one of us\" (261).This is a book for beginners and analysts; for the highly specialized depth-psychologist and layperson alike. It is one of the best books around: Jung's final summation of his monumental life-work.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"As a person new to investing and new to reading about investing, this book broke everything into articulate, informative, and entertaining chapters.

Doctorow has a way of evoking an era that reminds me of another of my favorite authors: Charles Dickens. Both authors write with gritty and amusing details about characters, places and events that allow me to imagine sights, sounds and smells as if I had been transported back to the time and scene of the action. Dickens and Doctorow are both gifted and elegant wordsmiths who take fictional characters and weave them into historical settings in such a way as to throw new light on familiar history.In \"The March,\" Doctorow drags us through the mud, slime, blood, ash, smoke, detritus and chaos that defined Sherman's \"March to the Sea.\" He also invites us to view the action through the eyes of a variety of participant observers - slaves, plantation owners, generals, privates, surgeons, heroes, traitors, survivors and victims of the juggernaut that was Sherman's Army on the march. The overall result was that for the first time, I feel as if I have some understanding of what that significant chapter in the Civil War saga was all about.I never really felt I had a grasp on the Battle of Gettysburg until I had walked the battlefield several time and stood on Little Roundtop and imagined Chamberlain's forces protecting the flank. Having been led by Doctorow through the pages of \"The March,\" I feel as if I have walked the virtual battlefield. One need not be a \"Civil War buff\" to enjoy this brilliant bit of writing. One need only bring to the table an appreciation for good literature and keen insight into human interactions under immense pressure.Doctorow describes the burning of Columbia, South Carolina:It seemed to him an exemplary justice come to this state that had led the South to war. Earlier in the day he had seen a company of Union soldiers who had been among the hundreds imprisoned right here in the city's insane asylum. The condition they were in appalled him. Filthy, foul-smelling, their skin scabrous, they were hollow-eyes creatures shambling to parade in a pathetic imitation of soldiering. You saw the structures of them through the skin, the bony residue of their half-human life, and you didn't want to look at them. The capital city of the Confederacy had treated these soldiers not as prisoners of war but as dogs in a cage. General Sherman had seen these men and had wept and now all he could think of was the Southern belles he had kissed.\" (Pages 184-185)As the March - and the War - neared their end, Sherman muses in Faulkneresque run-on loquacity about the meaning of it all:\"Though this march is done, and well accomplished, I think of it now, God help me, with longing - not for its blood and death but for the bestowal of meaning to the very ground trod upon, how it made every field and swamp and river and road into something of moral consequence, whereas now, as the march dissolves so does the meaning, the army strewing itself into the isolated intentions of diffuse private life, and the terrain thereby left blank and also diffuse, and ineffable, a thing once again, and victoriously, without reason, and, whether diurnally lit and darkened, or sere or fruitful, or raging or calm, completely insensible and without any purpose of its own.And why is Grant so solemn today upon our great achievement except he knows this unmeaning inhuman planet will need our warring imprint to give it value, and that our civil war, the devastating manufacture of the bones of our sons, is but a war after a war, a war before a war.\" (Pages 358-359)While you are in a Doctorow mood, I can also recommend his other works that I have feasted upon and digested: Ragtime, Billy Bathgate, The Waterworks, and City of God.Al","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"R. Syme reveals the real power players in ancient Roman society, the backers of the competing generals searching personal domination of the empire.That empire contained two classes of citizens: the patricians and the plebs. Rome was ruled without a real constitution (legality was a casual or partisan question). In fact, an oligarchy of 20 to 30 men detained all power strings. They represented whom? The main factions involved were the optimates (wealthy nobility), the nobiles (consular houses), the equites (provincial aristocracies, captains of industry and finance) and the novi homines (senators for the 1st time). Three other groups as a whole were politically very important: the plebs, the soldiers and the Senate.Ambitious generals tried to cement different factions into a block, a Party as a power base.Julius Caesar was a nobilis, backed by the plebs. By nominating many novi homines he took control of the Senate. He became the first Roman revolutionary by abolishing all political liberties and installing a dictatorship. He was stabbed to death by the defenders of the Republic.Marcus Antonius took the helm at the Caesarean Party, but Caesar also nominated a young nobilis as his heir, Octavianus. Provisory political stability was created through a triumvirate (M. Antonius, Octavianus, Lepidus) which installed a reign of terror, wiping out all political opponents through proscription and abolishing all private rights of citizenship. After the elimination of Lepidus, the two remaining triumvirs fought the battle of Actium: Octavianus became the sole master of the situation. In the choice between political freedom (and a new suicidal civil war?) or a stable government, the power players opted for the latter.The reign of Octavianus (Augustus) was backed by the plebs (panem et circenses), the military, the Senate (purified by nominating many novi homines) and the consuls (designated by the emperor). The power of the nobiles was broken. R. Syme characterizes his reign as plutocratic. Many novi homines were opulent men from the colonies and the municipia (Italy without Rome). In reality, Rome was ruled in secret by members of his family (Livia) and personal adherents (Maecenas, Agrippa).R. Syme's book contains many in depth portraits of major power players. A few examples: Cicero was the head of the optimates who intended to employ Octavianus in order to destroy the Caesarean Party and to restore political liberty. Octavianus was a hypocrite and opportunist chameleon, who seized power through bribery, fraud and bloodshed.This magisterially and clear analysis of a power struggle is a must read for all historians and for all those interested in the history of mankind","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Gives a warm Christmas feeling and and a sensible lesson.

James book, it is also her best work in some time. She has gone back to the core of her work, to murder and to Adam Dalgiesh, the Commander. He is still at Scotland Yard and the book is still about people that come into contact with a murder and how it affects them. In contrast to several other very good writers writing today about their continuing characters, Adam Dalgiesh shows no sign of becoming a private eye, and this is a very good thing for us.I think that what I really like about P.D James is her gift for expressing apparently intuitively an insight into the core her characters. She knows what makes these individuals run. They each react to the intrusion of a full scale police investigation in a believable fashion. These individual reactions of each of her characters are different, but they are so incredibly nuanced that they are seemingly real. It is as close as you can get to a fictional person. You feel that the author actually knows these characters as people, and what they think and how they feel, each of them. They are not stand ins for the author.I do not remember if she has been doing this for a while, but there were several words in this book that I admit that I had to mark to look up later. An example of this was the word \"etiolated\" at page 244. I had never seen the word before and had not an idea what it meant. Merriam-Webster OnLine says it means: \"1 : to bleach and alter the natural development of (a green plant) by excluding sunlight; 2 a : to make pale b : to deprive of natural vigor : make feeble.\" That makes sense and given the context it was clear enough, but there were six or seven of these words that I finally had to look up one after the other - it was fun.But it is not for the words that I read P.D. James, nor even for the characters, how ever well and completely presented, rather it is for the writing, an example: \"He was after all, a poet with a writer's interest in the fabric of other lives.\" at page 243. That is to me a beautiful sentence, and in context it is close to perfect. It expresses the poetic side of her major character poetically, and talks of the author as well. It is multifaceted. It is elegant. It is prose carried to the edge by an author in full command of her arsenal of words. But the book itself shows an author in full command of her story as well, and that is special too.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I found this book to be very informitive in how the mind works and respect to how people learn.

The book seemed to start falling apart for me after the first sex scene, which was VERY hot, as the main character Kate, has an unforgettable seduction scene with James in which she must convince him she is a whore, rather than being faced with the possibility of hanging for treason. We already see that James suspects Kate\/Katherine's (sexual) innocence, but after taking her, it seemed strange that a man of his supposed experience had no indication that he'd just taken a virgin. I kept waiting for it - even for a sign on the sheets, but any physical evidence is ignored by the writer and there obviously would be the physical barrier, pain for her - something. Then, it degenerates from there with James lapsing into alternating boorish, callous behavior, and being nauseatingly gushing and obsessive in his thoughts and emotions over Kate - even after he believes her to be a true whore, and responsible for a betrayal that leads to his near-hanging and ruin of his good name, estrangement from his loved ones, inheritance and family estates, etc. The end does not satisfy! The loose ends are never sewn up, and from this reader's' perspective, he never has the epiphany moment desired, i.e. that Kate is not a whore, what she did and did not actually do to betray him, and why she did it, etc. He just is obsessively \"in love\", and unrealistically satisfied with having her, even though his life has been ruined, and his eyes, she's still he traitorous little whore.

He is on a crash-course towards bloody violence, mitigated by Kilgore Trout - writer of psychotic science-fiction tales. In his almost juvenile, simplistic prose, Vonnegut takes us on a harrowing ride through the mind of two lunatics, bouncing off the peripheral characters like murderous pinballs.So, if you've acclimatized yourself to the utter genius of Kurt Vonnegut, then read on. If not, then perhaps it's best to test the waters first with his other works. You may never be the same again.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"would have been an ideal alternative title for this little gem!

Learning came from doing, carefully recording results, applying lessons learned and improving results. In addition, the book describes how sustainable practices can also be economic engines for new product development and cost reduction.I've recently been in Tanzania looking at community development projects and I plan to send this book to several of the people that I met.

This system allowed me to escape the \"Great Correction\" that began Summer 2008 (and still \"correcting\" by the way).Incidentally, the \"system\" which I developed . . . requires no more than about 10 minutes each week, and is normally done on my computer over morning coffee on Saturday mornings.I am not a skilled technician, and I certainly am not a knowledgeable fundamentalist.

I do not normally care for shape-shifters, but Haldeman somehow pulls this off, with a quasi-scientific approach, which, while perhaps not biologically feasible, was \"believable enough\" for me to suspend disbelief.The weakness, overall, are the two-dimensional human characters in 2019 who're trying to uncover the artifact's mysteries. I found myself wanting to breeze through these parts of the books in order to see what the chameleon or the changeling would do next.That said, the strengths outweigh the weakness, though, and I'll give this one 4-stars for its humor, its page-turning prose, and the tantalizing and chilling exploits of the chameleon.

I've seen this idea explored everywhere from Sondheim to anime. And boys wandering into alternate universes has been a standard plot since the Mabinogi, a thousand-plus years ago.I didn't find the plot original, and so the book for me came down to: how well did the author tell the tale? And I give him mixed results here. The book starts off well, but before the half-way mark settles into a dull \"get from A to B to C\" adventure. Part of the difficulty is that we know the ending by the second chapter, so all we have left is the journey itself.For all that, there are long stretches where the book is a great read. The second half is fun and engaging, albeit dark.

I remembered starting this as a teenager and giving up on it, but I decided to give it another try.I'm glad I did, as I was finally ready for it.As far as \"plot\" goes, it can be summarized fairly quickly. You probably won't be turning the pages to see \"what happens.\" But you could be drawn in to find out how Stephen's mind progresses -- to me, the most appealing part of the book. As Stephen progresses from childhood to adulthood, you can see each chapter become more complex -- it's one of the best portrayals of intellectual maturing that I've ever read. Some great portions include the dinner table argument about Parnell, the hell sermon, and the conversation about the nature of art.It feels really presumptous to write a review of what is widely considered to be one of the greatest novels of all time, but I guess that is what reviews on Amazon are for.

If you're the type of person who worries about being struck by lightning while reading the wrong kind of book, stay away from &quot;Small Gods.&quot; Terry Pratchett blasphemes against (or maybe I should say 'explains') religion in this book, and most philosophies too. This is one of his more seriously comic Discworld books, although only Pratchett (and Monty Python) would even consider an attempt at a comedy about the Grand InquisitionIf Galileo had muttered, &quot;Eppur si muove!&quot; to the Inquisition on Discworld, he no doubt would have been referring to the gigantic turtle that carries the world on its back. He would have burned too, old as he was, if Vorbis the exquisitor had overheard him blaspheming against the perfect sphere of Discworld, which orbits around the Sun &quot;as Man orbits the central truth of Om.&quot;Meanwhile Om scrabbles out of the compost heap and discovers Brutha, a young novice who is hoeing melons in the temple garden. Brutha is the only person left on Discworld who truly believes in Om, and really bad things happen to gods who lose all of their believers.However, Brutha almost loses his god. Vorbis the exquisitor discovers the small tortoise hissing at him and doesn't recognize it as his God, Om. He flips it over, inserts a couple of pebbles into its shell so it can't right itself, then sticks Om on the garden wall to broil in the sun.Vorbis is a bad 'un.After this temporary setback (setback, get it?), &quot;Small Gods&quot; carries on with the tale of Om and Brutha and their adventures as Om tries to figure out why he ended up as a tortoise, and Brutha attempts to discover truth in religion. This book is a work of fiction. All the characters and events portrayed in this book are fictional, and any resemblance to real people or incidents is purely coincidental. However if you read very carefully, you may spot coincidental resemblances to Tom&aacute;s de Torquemada, Jesus, any number of classical Greek philosophers, early Christian saints, Old Testament prophets, and Galileo Galilei.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This is a thoroughly engrossing portrait of the chaos that devastated Sierra Leone throughout the 90's. Campbell weaves the many disparate strands that coalesced to cause this tragedy together into a compelling narrative that is far more readable than anything else I've come across on the topic. The work ultimately has little new to say about solutions to such situations, mostly because it reveals the full complexity behind the conflict and the lack of any clear or easy answer. I was pleased to see in the film Blood Diamond that many of the evocative details from this book had been preserved, making it a powerful, and hopefully very important, movie.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This is one of Michael Connelly's best books, which is saying a lot, because he has written a lot of terrific novels. If you have enjoyed Connelly in the past, then you are sure to enjoy this book as well. Although he takes a departure into the legal world, Connelly still sticks to his strengths - crime. Connelly is a fantastic storyteller that takes you through a crime being committed all the way until the crime is solved. And every time, you are on the edge of your seat.Connelly's hero (or maybe even anti-hero) is Mickey Haller, a criminal defense attorney that Grisham would have loved to create. He represents anybody who can pay and operates most of his day in the back of his Lincoln. The funny part is his 2 ex-wives and his relationship with them still - one is his secretary and the other is a prosecutor that he sees around the courthouse often. Louis Roulet is his \"franchise client\" who tells Mickey enough lies to make him question his innocence. The courtroom scenes that follow in this book were some of the best in recent memory of legal thrillers. It would make you think that Connelly used to be a lawyer because he has obviously researched it thoroughly.Strong points on this book is the balance of humor and suspense. Mickey's love of hip-hop music and funny comments and insights keep you laughing at loud. At the same time, the suspense keeps you reading rapidly as you try to figure out what Mickey is going to do next and who he can trust.I found this book very similar to Philip Margolin's \"Last Innocent Man,\" which I also enjoyed. Same basic plot where defense lawyer is tired of representing guilty people when he finally thinks he is representing an innocent man (and then begins to have doubts). Both books also have an ex-wife as an opposing prosecutor. Both also execute very well with a entertaining read with enough twists to keep you guessing until the end.I recommend this book highly to anyone who likes Michael Connelly or likes fresh legal thrillers. With so many authors in the genre now, it's hard to find a legal thriller as good as this!","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"A fascinating glimpse into a bygone era fraught with hardship.

I intend to make my way through ALL of them.That said, I have to agree with everything that Ivy, the 'Avid Reader' had to say. There are things not to like in this story.I would have liked to see more of Vane's (vast) powers - he didn't come across as powerful and scary for 90% of the book - more like a loveable dog. I was confused by the fact that he and his brother, Fang, had collars on in the opening of the book that inhibited their powers. It was a story element that was not explained. In fact, Vane was down and out more than once in the story, and only hints were made of the extent of his powers. As if there is a future story waiting to be told, of which this novel only provides the backstory.I never got what it was that brought Fang around, and am a little irritated with the author about an apparent 'Deus es Machina'. I said to myself - WTF! I was also irritated that Fury appeared, 'feral, and dangerous', so-called, and yet had so little to do. It's possible I have to read other books to get more of him (great character), however a really good writer would have woven his arc into this story a little better. He and Fang, and Vane come a long way together in this book. There is a spot in the middle where a little more depth, tension, and mystery about Fury's character would have been appreciated. The author could have strung us out a little longer about Fury.But mostly I enjoyed the interpersonal interplay. I did feel a sense of romance between Vane and Bride (hated that name). I loved their date together. I felt the struggle with Vane to control his animalistic nature, and that was a compelling part of the story, for me. There were spots that were laugh-out-loud funny. I certainly enjoyed the humor. The familial relationships were very enjoyable. I loved the Thanksgiving Dinner scene. There was a charming sense of family that Vane and his brother's were missing. The sex was hot. While I bought Bride's size 18, and loved her for it - loved seeing her through Vane's eyes and that he saw beauty in her curves (I've been a size 18), towards the end I did feel like the author harped on that subject just a little too long. So that it became like nails on a chalkboard. This is not the first time I've noticed a Kinley\/MacGregor story obsessing about beauty. In fact all the Were-characters are supposedly (beautiful), in an over-the-top way. So you wonder if the author has some issues with that. Are these 'Mary-Sue' characters?But none of these remarks detract from the story. It is entertaining. It's not going to win a pulitzer prize for literature. So my recommendation is ... read it, and ENJOY it for what it is. ;-)","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I'm 35 now, and I read this years ago as a teenager, and it's stuck with me through the years more than almost any book I've read.

When I saw the Morgan-Greer's incredibly similar design, I was intrigued -- even more so when I read that Greer had used the same sources as the Rider-Waite deck, only his intent was to give them a \"modern\" interpretation. Almost all the Egyptian, Hebrew, and classical symbolism is gone, and there are no borders. This leaves fewer and larger images that are drawn in more life-like detail than the Rider-Waite. This in turn, at least for me, makes them easier to use for divination. (With the Rider-Waite, I sometimes get distracted by the details of the card, rather than focusing the oracular meaning.)There were some disappointments, primarily in the court cards. While I disagree with the practice of turning the Pages into Princesses, these were rather unequivocally masculine for my taste. (Except for the Page of Cups, which interestingly, Arthur Waite describes as \"effeminate\" in his Pictorial Key to the Tarot.) What really bothered me, however, was the depiction of the Queen of Swords, defined as the hardest and perhaps the strongest of the Queens. Greer's looked the youngest of them all, with no facial lines, rather wholesome and ingenuous. (The \"piercing stare\" effect described in the included paperback did not come across that way to me.) Oh, well.But the crux of the deck was the oracular meanings provided in the \"mini-book\" that came inside the card deck. So many of them were down-to-earth (and tersely applicable to today's mundane, materially-oriented world), even for the traditionally \"cosmic\" cards like The Fool and The Earth. It was startling at first, but after putting everything in context, it was a viewpoint that really worked.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" is a scrumptious new large-format imaging of a favorite classic for children.

He had already established himself as a wonderful author whom was loved and respected for his clever word choice and characters, but the authoring of this book called him into question in some eyes.He tells the story of an occupied country, more importantly, an occupied city, where the invading soldiers come into a peaceable-minded people's town and try to slowly take power; eventually seeing that no one takes well to enslavement, and winter begins. Steinbeck gives each character on each side equal time to tell their reasons for being there, for killing the soldier, for falling in love with the coal miner's wife and visiting her on rounds, for being a mayor who stands up to the colonel but does not consider himself to be very brave.We find out the minds of all creatures of war, the occupied, the enslaving, the confused and angry.\"Good.

I tried the book with several english speaking lao persons and lao speaking native english speakers while travelling around the country and all had problems with the transliteration. Nothing is like you would naturally pronounce it. For example who would say Khoj if you see Khawy?Helpful is the lao bit so you can point, in the end its how I got around. A pity, there are much better transliterations around.","sentiment_score":0.4},{"review":"Once more Jerry Robbins and the Colonial Radio Theater do another fabulous production of one of Ray Bradbury's works. The Martian Chronicles is quite possibly Ray Bradbury's finest fantasy writing and perhaps an allegorical tale of what happened to the Native Americans as this country was settled. Anyway this is the fourth production of CRT's in regards to Mr. Bradbury's works. The first three are Dandelion Wine, Something Wicked This Way Comes, and the wonderful Halloween Tree. If it really needs saying out loud I own and HIGHLY recommend these as well!I had yet to read the Martian Chronicles so I bought a copy and read a few stories and then listened as this recording makes the words, characters and sounds of Mars literally leap off the page and into your ears! This is another triumph of CRT's and they only seem to get better! The beautiful part about them is when they adapt something they stick closely to the source material instead of trying to re-write it entirely. Jerry Robbins did the adapting and directing and it shows. You even get to hear his voice in several of the productions which is always a treat.OK! That's enough reading reviews!

He is a master storyteller, in many ways I consider him superior to Asimov and Heinlein, because he is better able to take an effective turn to the dystopia or macabre genres.This book is truly one of the best unfortunate futuristic or dystopia stories ever written. Montag is a fireman, only now they start fires rather than put them out. The job of the fire department is to wait around for an informant to expose someone who still owns books. If that tip turns out to be accurate, they go to the house, douse the books with kerosene and then burn them.As the story opens, Montag is like his comrades in the fire department, he loves his job and never thinks too much about the consequences of what it is that he is doing. However, when one woman prefers to go up in flames with her books rather than live without them, he begins to have doubts. Unfortunately, his is not a society that deals easily with people having such doubts and he becomes a criminal on the run.In typical Bradbury style the story ends on an ambiguous note. While Montag is still living and there is the potential for a better future, it is not a certainty. Fortunately, he is now among other people who cherish the knowledge contained in books, so there is hope that literary civilization will rise again.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"The Summons, by most standards, is a well written book with a interesting plot line.

Yet that is precisely what happened on Cape Cod back in 1962, as chronicled with love and honesty by the author. What happens when the human world becomes a substitute for Nature? Is the orphaned wild creature better off with its own kind, or with an adoptive family of a different species? Readers must judge for themselves in this charming tale about a delightful female quail, misnamed Robert.Written with humor and pathos by an observant neighbor, who became Robert's Aunt and longterm hostess, this slim volume is a gem about surprising family adjustments. Human emotions seem to have rubbed off on this impressionable birdling, who rapidly becomes a member of the family--even to requiring babysitters. You will chuckle and weep over her antics and trials. How human can a bird get?

Chown explains:\"What follows are my dispatches from the frontier of the [scientific] imagination. At first sight, these ideas may seem crazy. But, then, once upon a time, the idea that time slows down for someone traveling fast or in the presence of gravity seemed crazy...Of course, the scientific imagination must work within the limits of known facts...I hope that in reading this book you will get some feeling of what a wonderful, weird, wacky Universe we find ourselves in -- a place far stranger than anything we could possibly have invented. And I hope it gets you thinking...\"This book presents its ideas in three easy-to-read parts. The essence of each chapter will be highlighted in the form of a question:Part 1 (5 chapters):(1) Are there regions in the Universe where time runs backwards?(2) Are there an infinite number of realities where all possible alternative realities are played out?(3) Can the basic building blocks of nature (like electrons) be split?(4) Do atoms contain time machines?(5) Are extra space dimensions a possibility?Part 2 (4 chapters):(6) Is most of the mass of the Universe in the form of relatively small black holes?(7) Does the Universe contain invisible galaxies, stars, planets, and even invisible extraterrestrials?(8) Is our Universe one among an infinite number of separate and distinct universes?(9) Is it possible to make a universe in the laboratory?Part 3 (3 chapters):(10) Could there be billions and billions of habitable plants that are not orbiting a central star but that are traveling through interstellar space?(11) Was the life on Earth seeded from the depths of space?(12) Do extraterrestrial artifacts exist on Earth or throughout the solar system?Each chapter explains with no technicality each of its ideas and tells us of the extraordinary people (mainly scientists) who postulated these extraordinary ideas. The evidence for these ideas is also presented. As well, the problems with these ideas is also discussed.Readers of space and physical science should be acquainted with most of these ideas. But they will probably not be acquainted with the large detail that Chown presents that go along with these ideas.I was surprised to find a large, informative glossary. Concepts like \"causality violation,\" \"discoherence,\" and the \"ultimate ensemble theory\" are well defined.The bibliography or \"further reading\" section of this book is interesting. It presents for each chapter non-fiction as well as fiction books!Finally, this book has no illustrations. I felt simple diagrams would have reduced the book's wordiness. I also found some slang in this book. For example, the word \"gonna\" is not even a word.In conclusion, this book definitely sparks the reader's imagination. It reminds me of what Albert Einstein once said: \"Imagination is more important than knowledge.\"(first published 2002; acknowledgements; forward; 12 chapters; main narrative of 155 pages; glossary; further reading, index)+++++","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"The book is about a girl, Jane Eyre, had a tragic childhood.

This was a romance novel which was written by Charlotte Bronte.At the beginning, Jane Eyre parents were dead. She lived with her aunt. Her aunt hated Jane Eyre very much. She broke her promise to her husband to bring Jane up as her own daughter. However, she was sent to Lowood School, study French Drawing and Music for 8 years. Luckily, she met a good friend called Helen to share her happiness and sadness in school since both of them were an orphan girl. Helen was then died of fever.

Then, she fall in love with the girl&iexcl;s father, the master Rochester. Although many twists between them before they had married, they were still end up happily.The book is a very famous love story. I like this book because the contradiction between two main characters, Jane and Rochester. It&iexcl;s different from others romance novel. It contains a lot of twist such as they loved each other but they were both afraid to tell their feeling to each other. It&iexcl;s because Rochester had a secret and Jane also had some misunderstanding to Rochester. Therefore, many love barriers between them. Besides, after Jane left Rochester. Jane still had many testes of true love.

When murder stops by in the form of a loyal patron having a heart attack during breakfast, the Lambros' are suspect since the autopsy shows poison!

IdaClare happens to be the mother of Hannah's boss and the drug trafficking charge is not amusing to the Windy City police. The police have arrested IdaClare for growing and distributing marijuana that she claims is for medicinal use for her and her peers.While on a date with Hannah, a Mr. Quince wants to die, draws a gun and forces David to kill him &quot;in a suicide by cop&quot; act. Detective Andrak investigates the scene and informs David that there is no gun. It appears that David used excess force to kill an unarmed person, which will invariable make him the first incumbent sheriff in Kinderhook County to lose reelection. Hannah and her elderly posse begin investigating what happened in order to clear David's name.SOUTH OF SANITY continues the amusing story of Hannah. The story line retains its freshness due to the peculiarity of its cast. The senior citizens provide depth with their antics such as eating too many marijuana- laced brownies (Alice is not here).

However, I did not read everything in each book because I simply didn't have the time. I did everything ARCO, which proved to be very helpful on the essays. I read all the review part and completed both tests in the Princeton Review. In Barrons I only read the parts that I was weak at (which was ch. 5-15). In Rea, I completed the 6 tests. Modern European history I read only parts that I was weak at. All today I convinced myself that I would do well because I had studied very hard. I have now come to the conclusion there is really no one great book...they are all great, just for different reasons. ARCO is good for the review, the part were they explain the essay part, and super for getting the main idea...which is what the real test is mostly about. Princeton Review is good for the practice tests, but it's review is not as clear as ARCO. Barron's is excellent for the review and is easier to understand than Princeton Review.

It tries to do for Guenevere what Mists of Avalon did for Morgan le Fey, but it fails sorely because the title character is an embittered shrew.

Arthur, by the way, is a weak, feeble-minded, doddering simpleton. This is not the great king of Arthurian legend at all. Lancelot is still a tasty dish, but there is no apparent reason why he would love a bitter, jealous, middle-aged woman who repeatedly casts him away. Morgan le Fey starts out as a promising character, but becomes a demonic harpy-type creature. And the tone is excessively anti-Christian. I'm not a religious person at all, but even I was offended by the way Christians are depicted in this novel. It's just not a pleasant read.

Through him Vonnegut explores the nature and lack of human connection to this world, the tragicomic loneliness of human existence, and most of all the absurdities of war, bringing a fantastical touch and his own experience to the terrible tragedies he depicts. The book is slightly difficult to read due to its rapid shifting between settings and times, but Vonnegut's prose is smooth and rapidly moving.

Upon reading the first sentence of this book, I was immediately captured by the story liveliness and soon found myself hooked. In addition to the lively, vivid tone of the book, what enchanted me the most was the seamless way in which each character behaviors and interactions were so carefully woven together in an intricate plot.Some characters that appear in the book are:- Mr. Bennet, a brilliant, sarcastic man who likes to ridicule the silliness of his wife- Mrs. Bennet, a middle aged woman who is eager to marry her daughters off to rich and prosperous families when they come of age- Their five daughters:- Jane, who, being the eldest, believes in human good and righteousness in all human beings,- Mary, their third child, who is always absorbed in books thinking about this and that- The shy Catherine, also known as Kitty, who always followed her flirtatious younger sister, Lydia around in flirting with officers.However, all the characters and indeed the whole story revolves around Miss. Elizabeth Bennet the second oldest sister, a witty, headstrong girl, and Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, a very queer, shy man. At first sight, Elizabeth's assumption and observation towards Mr. Darcy pride made her prejudiced against him.

Kafka's The Metamorphosis is one of those jumping off points for modern literature, a key touchstone where so many good writers -- Borges, Nabokov, Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez - found inspiration in his work and studied it like a textbook on great writing.But what is the metamorphosis? A dark fantasy about a man who wakes up one day to find himself transformed into a vile insect-like creature? Or an absurdist tale of a schizophrenic who believes he's been turned into a human-sized beetle, terrorizing his family with his decrepit mental state? Kafka left that open for us to decide, even asking his original publisher to remove any imagery involving an insect off the cover. The first edition cover (you can find it on Wikipedia: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Metamorphosis) is not a definitive statement on the story either. Is it the afflicted Gregor Samsa we see or his unnerved father fleeing from the sight of the creature in his son's room? As it was written in German, Kafka never definitively stated what Gregor had become. The term he used, in what has now become one of the more famous opening lines in literature, to describe Gregor's transformation was \"ungeheueres Ungeziefer,\" which literally means \"unclean animal not suitable for sacrifice.\" This has been translated (and mistranslated) as \"gigantic insect\" in some cases, but in later years, more translators have settled on \"monstrous vermin,\" as this seems to suit Kafka's vague intent much better. But if you want to read the numerous theories, Google the book. I'll leave it to those who are far more and far less philosophical than I.In its construction, The Metamorphosis is flawless. Kafka upends the entire structure of modern storytelling, giving us the climax first, never explaining the possible source for Gregor's affliction. Instead, Kafka leaves us in the d&eacute;nouement, showing us the ugly effects of Gregor's transformation on his too dependent family, who must now care for this unwanted monstrosity. As the tables are turned, the family shuns Gregor, locking him away. We then see Gregor move in two opposing directions -- becoming more louse-like in his basic behavior (such as eating garbage), but also more human in his fantasies (and sudden appreciation of music). It is this complex contrast that makes Gregor seem more human to us, thus playing into Kafka's slippery reality that confuses as much as illuminates.And yet, The Metamorphosis is not all doom and gloom. It's actually quite funny. Sure, it has a dark, black sense of humor, but nevertheless, you can't help but laugh at parts. When the new house maid spies Gregor for the first time, she does not turn tail, screaming in horror like his family. She merely states, \"Come over here for a minute you old dung beetle!\" Or the lodgers, who upon seeing Gregor slowly crawling towards them, do not try to smash him or exit the premises. They try to negotiate out of paying rent to Gregor's father in light of the \"disgusting conditions prevailing in this apartment and family.\" Even Gregor's ultimate fate, which I won't give away, is handled in a way that the cast members from Monty Python's Flying Circus would certainly appreciate.With so many layers to it, The Metamorphosis still remains one of the most studied and widely imitated novels of the 20th century. But in its purest sense, it is an amazing, perfectly crafted, dark little fable.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Dee Ito has the right idea.

The images are very diverse, drawing on many cultural, geographical, and spiritual correspondences. To allow the user more possibilities of interpretation, the pip (Ace-10's) cards have no humans in them. Court cards are identified as Prince, Princess, Knight, and Queen.

Then hire two good proof readers who read & write English as their first language.My suggestion to potential readers: Expect to have problems with this book.

He drove throughout the United States to reconnect with the inhabitants of the nation.Like any other tourist who travels too far too fast, he was unable to see everything, and he skimmed over many details in his tale.

It is a world where all freedoms have been eliminated in favor of the bureaucratic order. It is totalitarian, as occasionally one or two people wake up to this fact. There is only one crime, to think bad thoughts, and the main character is guilty, because he remembers the unofficial (and therefore non-existant) version of the past.What is most interesting about the book is how, in the end, they completely warped the thoughts of the protaganist so that he goes from wanting to rebel against the government to the last line of the book &quot;Winston loved Big Brother.&quot;That a government could progress to the point where it could twist a person's thoughts is frightening.

Owen, late professor emeritus of French in the University of St. Andrews, states of his translation that he kept \"the needs of students\" in mind. For that reason, Owen tells us, his \"renderings...incline towards the literal.\" In other words Owen's translation of Chr&eacute;tien of Troyes's \"Arthurian Romances\" shuns poetic and literary licence. Decide what you want. This is a scholar's book, a dry literal translation from twelfth century French of original tales that were too long to start with. General readers may find it dull.Near the end of his substantive Introduction (which itself makes a useful essay for students of Chr&eacute;tien's times) Owen comments that \"Chr&eacute;tien has bequeathed to us a brilliant portrait of the society that gave him his livelihood.\" That's true, but these romances set up portraits that will seem \"brilliant\" only from a scholar's perspective.Chr&eacute;tien's productive years spanned 1170 to 1182, the very pinnacle of chivalry -- and of chivalry's unlikely twin, courtly love. Chr&eacute;tien was an eye-witness, working in the halls of noble patrons, observing and recording the highest values of the culture of his time. He wrote \"Lancelot\" around 1177, dedicating it to Marie of Champagne (Eleanor of Aquitaine's eldest child), and bringing the world the first mention of Camelot. By 1182, Chr&eacute;tien was introducing the Holy Grail in \"Perceval: the Story of the Grail.\" Before he won fame under Marie's sponsorship, one wonders if Chr&eacute;tien had made his observations about the conventions of courtly love and chivalry earlier, at Eleanor's Court of Ladies in Poitiers (1168-'73). Owen was too much the perfect scholar to speculate, but we can. \"Arthurian Romances\" contains much that Chr&eacute;tien absorbed from an influential source, a royal hall replete with courtly traditions, poets and bards.

It has never lost its appeal to me. This epic saga emcompasses all of the major elements -- love, war, history, and memorable characters -- particularly the charismatic, witchy heroine Scarlett O'Hara and her male counterpart, Rhett Butler. Starting when Scarlett was sixteen, and the belle of the county, with dozens of beaus, she quickly moves with the times when war sweeps the antebellum South. In love with bookish, sensitive Ashley, she sees him off to the Civil War while marrying someone else, just because Ashley married someone else. She is quickly widowed, and journeys to Atlanta to stay with relatives. She has her eye on Rhett Butler, a stockade captain who plans to make money out of \"the fall of a civilization.\" For everything about the old life is being swept away in war -- \"cotton, slaves, and arrogance.\" Over the course of the novel, she slowly discovers who she truly loves, and goes for him. But he is too proud to reveal his true feelings for her, as she stubbornly clings to another man. Saving her plantation home from carpetbaggers, she decides to marry Rhett. It takes two tragedies for her to find out who has been saving her as a damsel in distress all of these years, and that he \"loves her to distraction.\" The novel is full of truths and themes that coincide again and again -- love triangles, the fall of an era and who survives the times in style, and friendship, family, and true love.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"When you discover Sandra Hill's writing, the little chills start very quickly and you know you're not just in romanceland anymore.Snug in the hands of a truly gifted author, you're swept up and spun into a world that will leave you gasping from wickedly imaginative, roaring good fun-- and ultimately wiser for the adventure.There are the seriously funny crossed sigals between ultimate fish-out-of-water Jorund, a naked God of a Viking the likes of whom women haven't seen for the past few hundred years and Maggie, the practical psychotherapist\/mother-of-two who adopts him as a patient.But Jorund is no rape-and-pillage stereotype--Ms Hill knows alot about Viking history and even more about the many shadings of the human spirit and the oddly beautiful ways that men and women connect. Viking values aren't so bad at all, it turns out, and the conflict between Jorund's original quest and his unfolding relationship with Maggie and the girls is both clever and poignant.In fact, this typically-flawed American male reader was reluctant to show this book to his wife out of Viking envy. Let's just say that, once you discover Jorund's brand of guyhood, you will ask as I did, &quot;what woman in her right mind would not want her own Viking?&quot;This book totally satisfies at so many levels, I believe you will hope as I do that Ms. Hill's Viking Chronicles continue at least until the end of this century.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I read this book before I read the first Harry Potter book, and I knew from the beginning it would be good.

Here's why.Chronologically, the first Lensman story wasGalactic Patrol, from Astounding magazine in 1937-38. This was followed by the next three stories:Gray Lensman,Second Stage LensmenandChildren of the Lens. When publication in book form was mooted, Smith revised his earlierTriplanetaryto fit into the lensman universe, and wroteFirst Lensmanto form a bridge between that and \"Galactic Patrol\".Masters of the Vortex, another unrelated story, was likewise modified.I, and many others it seems, feel that the four books representing Smith's original conception are the essential ones, and the others are disposable (\"Vortex\", in particular, being a pot-boiler with virtually no relation to the others). Although \"First Lensman\" certainly has entertaining moments (as when Virgil Samms is almost deafened at a Rigellian construction site, because the Rigellians have no sense of hearing and can't understand what the problem is).There's another problem with the books, although fortunately not an insuperable one. Smith's universe, although already huge at the outset of \"Galactic Patrol\", expands as the series progresses. Originally, the reader didn't discover the total significance of the struggles going on within it until the end of \"Children\". But the books (except, for some inscrutable reason, \"Patrol\") feature tacked-on and needless Forewords that give away the whole plot. I *strongly* recommend first-time readers to skip these.\"Triplanetary\" is not as good as \"Patrol\"; and if you start here you may be disappointed - possibly enough to stop reading!

It was AWESOME and life changing for the better! These CD's are EXACTLY the CD's used for the residential program at TMI. Each day we would have 2 sessions in the am, two in the pm, and 2 in the evening for the 6 days at the institute. The CD set consists of 6 CD's (Wave I-Discovery, Wave II-Threshold, Wave III-Revelation, Wave IV-Adventure, Wave V-Exploring, Wave VI-Odyssey). Each CD has 6 tracks guided by the reassuring voice of Robert Monroe and some of them have short excerpts of exceedingly beautiful music. This set takes you from Focus 3 to Focus 21 ( Information about the Focus levels can be learned on the Web). You can use these CD's to practice on your own, or as a preview before going to TMI. In order to do any of the other advanced programs offered at TMI one must have completed the Gateway Program because here you learn the foundation for the more advanced Focus levels. These CD's are like learning to ride a bike. Remember how cumbersome, difficult and scary it was when you first got on your bike? You had a million questions and were constantly wondering if you were doing it right, and terrified of falling. Learning to use these CD's is pretty much the same, there is trepidation, fear of failure, fear of the unknown, etc. but repetition and frequency gradually help you to relax into the process. Before you know it, you are off on your bike exploring the neighborhood.You may ask why I have purchased these CD's from Bostic Media here at Amazon if I have already been to TMI? I have purchased them to practice and review before I go to do the more advanced Lifelines Program later this year. I feel rusty, and need a refresher. Besides, I enjoy the physical and mental tranquility I experience when I do the CDs. In my opinion these are a wonderful tool that when applied correctly will allow you to learn much about yourself. The CD's MUST be used sequentially, that means Wave I Track 1 for X number of days until you are comfortable with it, followed by Wave I Track 2 x however many days until you feel at ease with the process, and so on with each track and CD. It should take weeks to master each CD. Don't get ahead of yourself too fast. Remember, it's a process. Enjoy it without expectations. Be open to whatever happens. Having expectations will only sabotage your efforts and frustrate you. The CD's themselves do not insert waves in your brain to change you, or put subliminal messages in your head, or do anything that forces you to change in any way. What the CD's do is provide an opportunity for self-exploration by facilitating the synchronization of the two hemispheres of the brain so they work together as one. YOU do the work yourself, not the program. Your results are proportional to the amount of effort you are willing to invest in the process, little effort....little result. Also, get a good set of headphones that allow the splitting of the sound waves. I use the ones that came with my iPhone, and have a set of Bose Pods.

This just might be the ticket to get them to enjoy reading at a young age!","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I was 12 years old and had the rare privilege of going shopping alone with my Mum. (With 2 sisters and a brother, this event was EXTREMELY rare.) I asked if we could browse in the book store. Half an hour later, we emerged. I was carrying a paperbag in which was enclosed my first copy of 'Pride and Prejudice'. As soon as we got in the car I started reading. I finished the book that night and I started it again the next morning. Even at 12 years old, I knew I was experiencing a masterpiece. In the 15 years since that day I have revisited the story of Elizabeth and Darcy numerous times. It just keeps getting better and better. Elizabeth was my idol. Darcy replaced Prince Philip, (from Disney's 'Sleeping Beauty'), as the man of my dreams. Mrs Bennett's nerves began to irk me as much as they did the long-suffering Mr Bennett. I love this book and I can't even begin to praise it, and the wonderful Jane Austen, enough. If you haven't read it - WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? If you have read it, I think its time to get it off your shelf, or get down to the library and relive the magic of 'Pride and Prejudice' all over again.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This is not a review of the book itself, just a warning for anyone thinking of getting the Kindle edition.The people who published this for Kindle should be ashamed of themselves for selling this product with a straight face.As Kindle books are often scanned from printed versions, I'v grown accustomed to seeing the occasional mis-scanned word, as they are usually sparse and don't distract from the content.This book, however, contains hundreds of mis-scans. I'm talking about a few every page (some pages might contain up to 10 errors). And these are errors that routinely distract from the content of the book, as the errors will sometime spell a different word altogether, giving a sentence a completely different meaning that you will only realize is nonsensical after reading an entire paragraph.Plus, 2 times out of ten, the combination of letters \"th\" will be scanned as \"di\". As you must realize, die difficulty of reading dirough paragraphs full of diese errors, in die kindle version of diis book, dioroughly distracts from the enjoyment of die material.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"i give porno 5 stars. you can not beat this bunch. its great to find out what happened to the crew after mark left......simon is very \"typical\" sick boy, and he will never change. he makes me laugh at the cruel reality of life, i love it..... i also enjoyed the new characters involved in this latest \"scam.\" cheers to sick boy and cheers to mr. welsh","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Plenty of good books have been written to help people &quot;code their own&quot; HTML (HyperText Markup Language) Web pages. HTML Virtual Classroom by Robert Fuller impresses me as being one of the easiest HTML books to learn from, that I've seen, in a long time.The author surveys the functionality and use of the more common HTML tags - including line and paragraph breaks, text attributes, image attributes, text and image alignments, background coloring, fonts, forms, frames, tables, layers, cascading style sheets, and hyperlinking. He also devotes quality time to help his readers fully develop their Websites - not just teaching them &quot;the coding&quot; part. He provides detailed instruction for smartly working with text, images, colors, Web browsers, story boarding, testing, and uploading created Web pages. For instance, readers are encouraged to sketch out their Website design ideas - on computers, graph paper, index cards, or napkins. Cute, clever, and outstanding advice!The book is accompanied by a multimedia CD containing a number of video lessons in both the Windows and QuickTime file formats. They are definitely designed for enhancing the learning process. Lesson content is delivered at a comfortable pace and is clearly presented. As author Robert Fuller can be seen speaking to his students the instructional content of his book comes to life on the screen. Readers can freely move back and forth between the book and the video presentations to learn at their individual paces. Furthermore, the video lessons can be played back and backed up as often as necessary to drive the instruction content home. Depending upon individual computer system specifications, some readers may prefer to copy the lesson files to their computer hard drives for smoother and more convenient viewing!HTML still continues to serve as the foundation of Website design. Although other markup languages have arrived on the scene that offer their own advantages, there is still great demand for HTML programming skills for creating business Websites. Robert Fuller delivers superb instruction. This book is highly recommended for classroom, workshop, small business, and organizational use. I can't wait to get my hands on his Dreamweaver book!","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This novel is an intriguing account of an elderly woman's experiences in World War II. The author captures the character of Mamie perfectly, bringing her to life in every respect. I loved the book; once I started it I couldn't put it down!

I love to read different kinds of books, but I realy love to read longer and more interesting books. I think any girl of any age should read Jane Eyre, because if you realy have a hard time in life you realy should read this...If I could I would give this book six stars!!!","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This was my favorite read of 2001. I hadn't ever read a book by Rose Tremain and merely picked it up because I was on my way to Copenhagen from London on a business trip. I became so involved with each of the characters that I made a special trip to the palace where the fictional story took place, bought postcards of the people on whom the fiction was I presume loosely based, and remembered parts of the book as I passed through the rooms. I also went up the round tower thinking all the time of the storyline in which this tower took part. What I think is so amazing though about this book is not just the historical details but the sexy sense of humor throughout, the understanding of music and the meaning of music in people's lives, and the author's wicked depiction of the king's wife. I really couldn't put it down, longed to get back to it when I did, and mourned the end of the story. I tried to get by book group to read it. It is definitely a book group read. So many characters to discuss; so much history; and so much interesting sexuality! The whole thing was just delicious reading!","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"If you were to cross Jane Austen's Emma Woodhouse with E. F. Benson's Lucia, the result (psychologically as well as chronologically) would be Margaret Oliphant's triumphant queen of Carlingford society, Lucilla Marjoribanks. Determined to show everyone an entertaining time (ostensibly &quot;to be a comfort to dear Papa,&quot; even though her father tends to withdraw entirely from her noisy gatherings), the self-centered but always ingenious Lucilla engineers social triumph after social triumph in this very amusing mid-Victorian novel. There were many moments when I laughed out loud, or was genuinely surprised by Lucilla's cleverness in overcoming momentary catastrophes. This is the perfect book for anyone who has loved Austen, Trollope, or Elzabeth Gaskell's WIVES AND DAUGHTERS.","sentiment_score":0.8},{"review":"This illustrated edition is a very beautiful book in terms of its binding, quality, the many photographs inside and its information. But the story remains the same. Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: The Illustrated Edition: An Indian History of the American West by Dee Brown tells us of the same injustices that have been done to our Native American co-inhabitants of this country. We see how the first white men and women who came to New England were helped by the Indians or else starvation would have been their end. Brown even goes before those years to the days of Columbus and other explorers who used native peoples to their own advantage. We also read about the westward displacement of people who were driven from their homes and forced to move to a different part of the country, on foot. President Andrew Jackson moved thousands farther west in what became know as the \"trail of tears.\" As a retrospective newspaper indexer I read the firsthand account of this in an old newspaper from the times, and President Jackson said that this was for their own good. When reading about the Trail of Tears, I failed to see how that could be.If you've read the book, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, this edition makes an excellent addition to a home library. Illustrations always help to tell a story as well, and sometimes better, than words. In this book, you get both.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Milan Kundera is a Czechoslavakian writer who lives in France. He's written a number of novels, among the THE BOOK OF LAUGHTER AND FORGETTING and THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING. In this, his first nonfiction effort, Kundera relates the concept of the novel to his own work. The first two essays were inspired by an interview he gave to The Paris Review on his practical experiences with the art of the novel.His focus goes beyond his own work, however. Kundera presents some rather intense and unusual analyses of his personal favorite writers: Cervantes, Rabelais, Sterne, Diderot, Flaubert, Tolstoy and Kafka, to name just a few.This is a book for the scholarly reader; the reader who knows literature. It is one that illuminates all sorts of possibilities for writing the novel, for Kundera points out the the novel can express life in ways that can't be achieved by any other form.He moves from the general to the specific -- from the form of the novel, to the way others have used it, to his own work. Particularly interesting is his dictionary of 63 key words which he says are essential to understanding his fiction. His observations about the state of contemporary Russian literature -- what is being published and why -- are fascinating. He also expresses his frustration, as an author, with translators of his works and how they handle language.&quot;The art of reading,&quot; wrote Andre Maurois, &quot;is in great part that of acquiring a better understanding of life from one's encounter with a book.&quot; Readers will come away from this with a better understand of the novel as an expression of life as well as deeper insight into a number of classical works.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"I read this book when I was in high school which was about 6 years ago and at the time I was quite enthralled with it. I read it again not to long ago and I found it to be just as entertaining as I remembered. I read quite a few months before the movie came out and I was blown away by that as well.

Unfortunately, so many of the recipes are family favorites that are simply handed down through generations that very few traditional recipes are written anywhere.For example, if you're not native to the southwest, you'll have extreme difficulty finding a recipe for Carne Adovada (p. 51), simply because most southwest cooks make this wonderful dish with as little thought as most people give to scrambled eggs.This little gem presents almost 100 recipes. Some are very traditional, everyday dishes like guacamole, chile con queso, etc. Others are less tradtional, like Glazed Grilled Quail and Venison with Chipotle Cream. In addition, the author explains the ingredients necessary to create these southwest dishes.My only complaint is that the book doesn't open flat. But that's not a big deal - by now, it falls open naturally to my favorite recipes.","sentiment_score":1.0}]
