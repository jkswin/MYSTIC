I absolutely love the direction GameFreak is going for with this whole new installment for the Pokemon series, and it is very refreshing, while being very needed at the same time. Catching Pokemon in this game is more fun than ever, and I'm a fan since the first era with the FireRed\/LeafGreen versions. It's way more than a nostalgia trip : it is a brand new experience and I sincerely do hope that we will see a bigger sequel to it because the game really deserves one with further gameplay enhancements, maybe a bigger map with more activities. Cheers to all the haters! ;)","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Incredible game that moves the Pokemon series forward in a fresh new direction. The gameplay loop is fun, and while the graphics aren't great, they are more than fine. Gameplay should always take precedent over graphics, and Legends: Arceus is a joy to play!","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Im so addicted! New mechanics and ideas are really fantastic! Can\u2019t stop playing it! Over 40 hrs and still can\u2019t put down the console! The world is really beautifull, exploration is truly amazing.

Enjoy!","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"This is the best Pok\u00e9mon game I've ever played.

I been playing the game for over 10 hours and honestly most fun I had in years with a Pokemon game. This game is testing grounds for future Pokemon games in this style. So let's put the graphics aside for a moment and look at the bigger picture here. Aside from Graphics do you want more. Pokemon games like this? I sure do, that's why despite the graphics needing more, that this game deserves a 10.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"Excellent step in the right direction for Pokemon.

It\u2019s a blast.

Yes graphically it could be better, but at least for me it doesn't effect my entertainment level in this case. The thing that is really mattering to me is just how much fun it is, once I have started it is hard to stop for hours. It has a gameplay loop that feels good and is very much a \"Just one more thing\" sort of loop.

The smoothness of the gameplay loop is ridiculously good, I\u2019m truly having fun like the the first time I played a pokemon game and re living the wonder I felt diving into Hyrule in Botw.This is a 9,6 rounded up, because some details in the shadows should\u2019ve been dealt with properly.

The performance is ok; it doesn\u2019t ruin the immersion, but it could be better.This game has a lot of variation, it\u2019s really an experience and gives the same feeling I felt when playing other famous switch titles. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing the publisher build off this formula.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"When I was 10 years old Pokemon Blue and Red Version were released on the Gameboy.

Pok\u00e9mon battle transitions seamlessly take place in the overworld, and only happen when you throw out one of your Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s Pok\u00e9ball. This removes annoying random encounters, but there\u2019s still danger to traversing the wild. Aggressive Pok\u00e9mon will attack you! It\u2019s pretty difficult. Battle animations have received an overhaul and now look super cool and actually run over and hit each other. They are also properly sized, and wild Pok\u00e9mon are now more powerful.

The Massive Openworld makes this game really interesting to discover More and MORE!!! With the ability to control the camera angle was great from Sword and Shield's wild area but in this game, we are free to use this feature everywhere. As well as the battles and while talking to NPCs in some case. I really enjoy playing this game and spending hours and hours in it catching'em all. Really appriciate their effort in this game. I am now looking forward to GameFreak's next project.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"New fresh bold improvement, everything in this is so lovable to me as rpg lovers.

Even if it is not perfect, I am still willing to give it an encouraging 1 point. It's very close to the Pokemon world I imagined when I was a child, but it's ten years late.

If it can maintain this level in the future, I will like to buy Pokemon games for my children.","sentiment_score":1.0},{"review":"The best and most refreshing Pokemon game to release in a very long time, so good it makes going back to the other pokemon games seem to be a chore.

Turns out, this is one is the great one. This game on itself is just as good as Gold\/Silver was back in the day. Initially, I'd give it 7\/10, but the more I played it the more I liked this - there's plenty of content in this one, and they're adding new quests in updates.

A lot of people complain about graphics; to me, it's just fine and doesn't disturb my eyes.The most awful thing in the game, in my opinion, is audio. Some sounds are way too junky or compressed.","sentiment_score":0.8672924251},{"review":"The most fun I've had playing a Pokemon game in a long time. The graphics could have used more polish with more detail but overall it isn't as bad as the outrage over it.

A much more entertaining gameplay loop. I didn't expect there'd be as many as 242 Pok\u00e9mon species in this game.The visual is great too.

No other Pokemon game has given me the sense of wonder and excitement that PLA has. This is the closest Pokemon has ever come to being a dream game. This is the first time I felt like I was fully immersed in a Pokemon world. There is so much attention to detail and the Battle Animations have finally got reached respectable quality. The game is rough around the edges and has the smallest lineup of Pokemon moves, but without a doubt this game should be a benchmark for all future Pokemon main series titles.","sentiment_score":0.0},{"review":"Fantastic game!

The characters are fleshed out without the 2000 sun and moon cutscenes every second and plays very smoothly.

It's a refreshing game!","sentiment_score":0.0},{"review":"The game is a breath of fresh air into the overdone Pok\u00e9mon formula. The new way of completing the Pok\u00e9dex make the process more interesting, compared to catching and forgetting about the Pok\u00e9mon. The graphics are a down side and need a lot of improvement. In my opinion graphics are less important when compared to gameplay. The part I don't like is the overuse of voiceless dialogue. The story is interesting compared to previous entries but is over run with boring dialogue.

Not as much as I would if it were a traditional pokemon game. My only gripe really is the opening; It felt like it took foreeeeeever to actually start my journey after having to shovel through dialogue and cutscenes, the tasks needed to advance. They just felt repetitive, and the world felt a bit empty. My entire time playing it, I was imagining what it would be like to do battle in a gym or wandering through kanto, hoenn, or johto regions with this new engine. I hope they think about doing such that for the next canon game.","sentiment_score":0.0},{"review":"Definitely imperfect and glitchy but lots of fun. I like that the battles are a bit more difficult.

Obvious complaints are the graphics, some Pokemon don't exactly interact with anything, but that's about it. Story wise it's a tad more mature than the older titles, which is always nice. I love the catching mechanics, and the lack of a ton of trainers on every route is incredibly refreshing. All the characters are unique in their own little ways, move animations are beautiful and I love the new battle system. Honestly everyone saying this is \"the worst pokemon game ever\" need to go back 2 years and play sword and shield.","sentiment_score":0.0},{"review":"Solid game. Very addictive gameplay. Battles are so streamlined compared to Sword and Shield they take about 1\/3rd of the time to complete. This time there's actually incentive to catch them all. Graphics are a huge letdown compared to BOTW. Music is good, not as good as BDSP. Where the game shines is the gameplay. I wish the world was more open like BOTW with less hand-holding, but compared to other pokemon games that feel like they're on rails this is a breath of fresh air.","sentiment_score":0.790659439},{"review":"Finally some fresh air in the pokemon franchise.Yes the game doesnt look good, yes it contains glitches, BUT after all those years, fan prayers were heard.A (kind of) open world with roaming and living pokemon everywhere, a new way to catch them and new methods to complete your pokedex.","sentiment_score":0.0},{"review":"The graphics are just bad. But that's the only big point. The gameplay feels great and i think this is a really good step for the next Pokemon games. The best Pokemon game i played on Switch.

With voice actors for the main questline and better graphics it would be a 10\/10. Still a great experience.","sentiment_score":0.0},{"review":"The game play is amazing, it's finally a redesign of the original formula.

Sure, the graphics could be a little better, but with the open world experience and that you can catch pokemon without having to engage into battle, it's really awesome.","sentiment_score":0.0},{"review":"In summary it is a classic game of Pok\u00e8mon, I would have preferred open world than open map and graphics maybe better (here we are at the level of Unity crap). However, the leveling system is strange, throughout the story you can also go to equal level but towards the end, you are required to have a team leveled well, this I call it unbalancing and not good at all.I sincerely hope that for other games in the series, they improve starting from their negative points but knowing Gamefreak......","sentiment_score":0.0},{"review":"A great step forward for the pokemon series, however, needs work. Honestly the most fun ive had catching pokemon and running through the world. This game has revamped the combat system as well as the pokedex. i would recommend this to anyone who has played pokemon and people who have been wanting something more from the franchise. The reason i gave this game an 8 is even though the world is fun to run around in and the combat is interesting, the game does look pretty bland mostly due to graphics. This is surely a great step forward for the franchise but there is a lot of room to improve!","sentiment_score":0.0},{"review":"This game is a promising evolution for the Pokemon series and I hope the direction the series will go in.

Gameplay is really good though, i would say that if you are able to look pass the story, lack of multiplayer battle system, gym battles and the horrendously bland and lifeless world of Hisui this is an alright game to pick up but with a company as big as Game Freak it feels kinda lazy and they should be doing more","sentiment_score":0.6366805307},{"review":"Completed in 20hours, was extremely boring story, no gyms or leagues. Easily exploited gameplay that allowed me to catch everything with a single ball and no aggro. Graphic so old it looks like ps2 era.

Add ability to throw a ball which is in pokemon go so it's nothing new.","sentiment_score":0.609338177},{"review":"It's good but it's lacking some heavy graphicals features that game from past 2010 have.

Unfortunately the lack of voice acting and polished\/improved graphics prevent it. That being said this is still a good game and worth the adventure for pokemon fans. It has me so excited for the future of what pikemon games have in store. I truly hope they will give one pokemon game the time and love it deserves to make a game as good as super mario odyssey and breath of the wild. This is the closest we have gotten to it. But there is still a long way to go.","sentiment_score":0.6728011283},{"review":"It's good, feels fresh. New catching system is great. It just feels kinda rushed thou and like it wants you to mainly be re-catching the same Pok\u00e9mon all the time to fill out that Pok\u00e9dex. And there is even less emphasis placed on story and battles. I don't like how there is almost no trainers battles, as having high level good Pok\u00e9mon being pointless.","sentiment_score":0.49},{"review":"The new style of gameplay is fresh and exciting, however I feel disappointed by the lack of PVP, pokemon abilities, and held items. The open world aspect is fun and questing feels more like a modern RPG than pokemon. While the graphics of NPCs and the game in general are laughable, the gameplay is smooth when throwing pokeballs and using a mount to transverse the open world.","sentiment_score":0.0},{"review":"A good improvement on the Pokemon formula. The gameplay loop is awesome if you're a completionist like me. The things that are being the score down is this game is either unoptimized on the switch or the switch is not powerful enough for the game. I think a mixture of both are true. There is a lot of pop in and I have seen other games that shouldn't be able to run on the switch be able to run quite well so this is disappointing. The other thing is the small Dex size. 240 Pokemon for a franchise that is right around 100 is too small to reasonably charge 60 bucks.","sentiment_score":0.681457464},{"review":"The game is very fun and addictive but the graphics are terrible and the gameplay feels like a Pokemon GO with open area elements like Monster Hunter. It's surely an enjoyable game if you're a Pokemon fan but we deserve better and Game Freak needs to take their time and make a fantastic game that can be forever remembered, not just rush game development and put low effort so they can make money from games every year.","sentiment_score":0.6923206056},{"review":"I like the exploration Mechanic's, but sometimes the game feels too repetitive. The missions would be more epic, I keep farming and exploring all the time. The alpha battles breaks this a little, but I miss the epic battles at gyms.","sentiment_score":0.0},{"review":"This game is definitely a fresh take on a repetitive formula. The main focus of the game is on collecting pokemon, and it does that better than pretty much any other game in the series. However, it also at times feels like you are play-testing an upcoming title. For one, the graphics look like something from 20 years ago. Furthermore, the main plot could be improved by voice acting. However, many vital features like breeding or online battles are just completely missing.","sentiment_score":0.6438178484},{"review":"A huge step into being the pokemon game I've dreamt of for years, but really could've used another year of dev time to add more and to polish.
